## STRATEGIC APPROACH

### The Pillar + Cluster Model

Rather than individual blog articles in isolation, this strategy creates **topic clusters** where:

1. **Pillar Page** = Comprehensive hub covering entire topic area (2,500-3,500 words)
2. **Cluster Topics** = Specific subtopics linked to pillar (4-5 articles per cluster)
3. **Cross-Cluster Links** = Strategic connections between topic areas

This approach establishes Google-recognized topical authority and allows Flood Doctor to own entire topic spaces.

### Primary Topic Clusters

| Cluster | Pillar Page | Subtopics | Keywords |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Water Damage Restoration** | Comprehensive service guide | Emergency response, categories, timeline, cost, DIY mistakes | 50+ keywords |
| **Mold Remediation** | Professional services hub | Mold prevention, remediation process, health risks, detection | 35+ keywords |
| **Insurance & Claims** | Claims documentation guide | Filing claims, claim denial, cost deductible | 25+ keywords |
| **Specialty Services** | Service directory | Fire/smoke, sewage, basement, storm (4 services) | 40+ keywords |
| **Prevention & Maintenance** | How-to guide hub | Seasonal tips, HVAC maintenance, roof/plumbing care | 20+ keywords |
| **Commercial Restoration** | Business services hub | Enterprise solutions, downtime mitigation, multi-site | 15+ keywords |
