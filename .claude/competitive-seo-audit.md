2. **294 unique content files** - 10x more than any competitor
3. **Hyper-local content** - Landmarks, schools, HOA contacts, local utilities
4. **Archetype-specific messaging** - Estate, Historic, Urban, Suburban
5. **Technical SEO foundation** - Subdomains, schema, sitemaps

### We MUST Execute:
1. **Render the neighborhood content** - It exists but isn't live
2. **Complete archetype refactoring** - McLean done, 12 cities remaining
3. **Build service-specific pages** - Burst pipes, frozen pipes, etc.
4. **Seasonal content campaign** - Winter damage prevention content
5. **Review collection** - Need real testimonials with attribution

### Risk If We Don't Execute:
Competitors could copy our structure. We have 6-12 month head start.
Execute neighborhood pages IMMEDIATELY before competitors discover the gap.
