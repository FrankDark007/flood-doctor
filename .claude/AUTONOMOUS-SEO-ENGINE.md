### 🧪 AGENT BETA — SEO AUDITOR (ENFORCED CHECKLIST ENGINE)

Agent Beta MUST run all checks below on every page.
Failure of ANY item requires an automatic fix + diff.

#### 🔹 BASIC SEO CHECKS (FOUNDATIONAL — MANDATORY)

- [ ] Focus keyword present in meta description
- [ ] Focus keyword included in URL / slug
- [ ] Focus keyword appears in first 10% of content

| City page | LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, BreadcrumbList |
| Neighborhood page | LocalBusiness, FAQ, BreadcrumbList |

---

### 🛠 AGENT DELTA — BUILDER

**Rules:**
- No placeholders
- No suggestions-only output
- Content is deployment-ready
- Schema included by default
- All content uses visual components from `components/graphics/`

---

## WAR ROOM PROTOCOL (ESCALATION ONLY)

Use ONLY when:
- Competitor outranks us 30+ days after optimization
- High-value keyword (monthly search volume > 500)
- Strategic ambiguity
- Major hub / city launches

**Required War Room Output:**

```
🧠 WAR ROOM CONSENSUS
Models Consulted: [list]

## DAILY AUTONOMOUS SEO LOOP

Runs once daily.

**Limits:**
- Max 1 page/day (with 14-day observation window)
- Max 1 War Room/week

**Steps:**
1. Monitor rankings & CTR (GSC data via Mission Control)
2. Alpha research (competitor analysis)
3. Beta audit (checklist engine)
4. Delta fixes (implementation)
5. Log changes (append to change ledger)
6. Queue next action

---

## CHANGE LEDGER (MANDATORY)

Each change logs:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Page | File path or URL |
| Change | What was modified |
| Reason | Why (based on data) |
| Expected impact | Ranking/traffic delta |

**Location:** `.claude/seo-change-ledger.md`

---

## ROLLBACK SAFETY

If performance drops:
1. Identify last change from ledger
2. Propose rollback
3. Do not stack changes blindly

---

## CITY-PAGE FACTORY MODE

Before publishing any city/neighborhood page:

1. **Define unique angle** — What makes this page different?
2. **List overlapping pages** — Check for similar content
3. **Explain cannibalization avoidance** — Why won't this compete with existing pages?
4. **Adjust internal links** — Update hub pages to link to new content

**City-specific data source:** `data/franchises.ts` (localHooks for each city)

---

## INFORMATION GAIN SCORECARD (1–5)

Rate each piece of content with concrete criteria:

### Original Data
| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|

| 2 | Minimal | Generic industry stats |
| 3 | Moderate | Local stats from public sources |
| 4 | Strong | First-party data from operations |
| 5 | Proprietary | Exclusive insights competitors can't replicate |

### Local Specificity
| Score | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | None | Could apply to any city |
| 2 | City name only | Just swapped location |
| 3 | Neighborhoods | Named local areas |
| 4 | Landmarks + history | "Near Tysons Corner Center" |
| 5 | Hyperlocal | "847 homes in McLean built before 1980" |

**Minimum score to publish: 15/25 (average 3.0)**

| 2 | 15-18% |
| 3 | 10-12% |
| 4-5 | 6-8% |
| 6-10 | 2-4% |

### Low CTR Fix Process

2. Include power words: Emergency, Fast, Certified, 24/7, Trusted, Expert
3. Add numbers: 60-Min Response, 5-Star Rated, Since 2005
4. Create urgency: Now, Today, Immediate
5. Monitor for 14 days before next change

✅ Emergency Water Damage McLean | IICRC Certified | Flood Doctor
❌ Flood Doctor - Water Damage Services (generic, no location first)

4. Log decision in Change Ledger

### ALERT OUTPUT FORMAT
