## ✅ COMPLETE: Schema Markup Audit + Rollout — P0 #1 (2026-02-15)

### Status: ALL PHASES COMPLETE — Deployed to production

### Audit Findings (full report delivered to user)

**Architecture:**
- All 188 pages use `components/ui/PageMeta.tsx` exclusively
- `components/seo/*.tsx` are dead code (not used in active routes)
- `utils/schema.ts` has all needed generators (Article, LocalBusiness, BreadcrumbList, Service, FAQ, HowTo, etc.) — they exist but most pages don't call them

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **0/45 blog posts have Article/BlogPosting schema** — `generateBlogArticleSchema()` exists but no blog page calls it
2. **0/45 blog posts have BreadcrumbList**
3. **0/21 location pages have BreadcrumbList**; 13/21 missing FAQPage
4. **12/12 landing pages have ONLY LocalBusiness** — missing Service, BreadcrumbList, FAQ
5. **Duplicate LocalBusiness on ~8 location pages** — array serialization creates bare JSON array + separate LocalBusiness = 2 conflicting entities
6. **3/3 service pages missing Service schema**

**PageMeta injection bug:**
- Single `<script id="json-ld-schema">` element
- When `schema` receives an array (e.g., `schema={[faqSchema, localBusinessSchema]}`), it serializes as bare JSON array, not `@graph`
- This + the `generateLocalBusinessSchema()` call elsewhere = duplicate LocalBusiness

**Implementation Plan (5 phases):**
1. Fix PageMeta: array → `@graph` handling + dedupe (INFRASTRUCTURE — do first)
2. Blog posts: add `generateBlogArticleSchema()` (45 pages, highest ROI)
3. Location pages: switch to `generateLocationPageSchema()` (21 pages)
4. Landing pages: add Service + BreadcrumbList + FAQ (12 pages)
5. Service/hub pages: add missing schema types

### Commits
- `8a1c104` — Phase 1: PageMeta @graph + dedupe infrastructure
- `26b21cb` — Phase 2: 45 blog posts → Article + BreadcrumbList
- `d60631a` — Phase 2: 29 location pages → BreadcrumbList + LocalBusiness
- `9b58d61` — Phase 2: 23 landing pages → Service + BreadcrumbList (via template)
- `7b00553` — Phase 3: Service templates + hub/index BreadcrumbList

### Result
Every content page now has structured data via centralized builders in `utils/schema.ts`. Deployed 2026-02-15.

## ✅ LATEST: Independent City Subdomain Architecture (2026-02-07)

### Status: Complete

### What Was Done

Converted from single SPA with runtime subdomain detection to 13 truly independent city websites.

**Before:** `mclean.flood.doctor` → Same React app, runtime detection, `/city/mclean` routes
**After:** `mclean.flood.doctor` → Independent React app, `/` is homepage, no shared routing

#### New Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/city.tsx` | Entry module for city subdomain builds |
| `/city.html` | HTML template with `window.__FLOOD_DOCTOR_CITY__` injection |
| `/CityApp.tsx` | City-specific router (/, /services/, /blog/, etc.) |
| `/contexts/CityFranchiseContext.tsx` | Static franchise provider (no runtime detection) |
| `/pages/city-app/*.tsx` | 9 city page components |

#### Modified Files
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `/vite.config.ts` | Added `VITE_BUILD_MODE=city` conditional input |
| `/package.json` | Added `build:city` and `build:cities` scripts |
| `/scripts/build-cities.ts` | Now reads from `dist-city/`, removed `npm run build` |
| `/App.tsx` | Removed ~40 city routes and ~20 lazy imports |

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build city bundle once
npm run build:city

# Build all 13 city sites
npm run build:cities

# Test locally
npx serve dist-cities/mclean -l 3003 -s
```

### Architecture

```
flood.doctor           → App.tsx (main site only, NO city routes)
mclean.flood.doctor    → CityApp.tsx (independent, city="mclean" baked in)
arlington.flood.doctor → CityApp.tsx (independent, city="arlington" baked in)
...13 total city sites
```

### Output Structure

```
dist-cities/
├── mclean/
│   ├── index.html   (window.__FLOOD_DOCTOR_CITY__ = 'mclean')
│   ├── assets/      (CityApp bundle)
│   ├── sitemap.xml
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── .htaccess
├── arlington/
└── ... (11 more)
```

### Cities Included

## ✅ LATEST: Static Pre-Rendering Implementation (2026-02-13)

### Status: Complete — 197/197 routes pre-rendered and verified

**Spec:** `docs/PRERENDER_STATIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### What Was Done (8 tasks)

| # | Task | Commit |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `config/routes.ts` — shared route source of truth (197 routes) | `da0e558` |
| 2 | `PageMeta.tsx` — `__PRERENDER_READY__` flag | `d784916` |
| 3 | `fd-home-v4/index.tsx` — add PageMeta to homepage | `1a8b592` |
| 4 | `scripts/prerender.ts` — Playwright-based pre-render engine | `5d0048e` |
| 5 | `index.tsx` — hydration detection (hydrateRoot vs createRoot) | `665ada7` |
| 6 | `verify-prerender.ts` + `package.json` build chain | `6cd7e7f` |
| 7 | `generate-sitemaps.ts` refactored to shared routes | `9ed8331` |
| 8 | Build, verify — 197/197 pass | `2b4bd53`, `315e43f` |

### Bug Found & Fixed

3 guide routes (`/guides/basement-waterproofing/`, `/guides/burst-pipe-emergency/`, `/guides/flood-preparation/`) passed `faqs={faqs}` to `LazyFAQ` but the component expects `data` prop. Fixed in commit `2b4bd53`.

### Prerender Architecture

- Custom HTTP server serves clean SPA shell as fallback (no sirv dependency)
- Homepage rendered last so its output overwrites dist/index.html
- 5 concurrent Playwright tabs, 15s timeout per route
- Full build: ~13 seconds for 197 routes
- Verification checks: file exists, >5KB, unique title, canonical, og:title

### Build Chain

```bash
npm run build     # vite build → generate:sitemaps → prerender
npm run prerender:verify  # Post-build verification
```
