      "Mason Neck's unique peninsula location between the Potomac River and Occoquan Bay creates water challenges that inland Lorton properties never face. Your waterfront or near-waterfront home deals with tidal influences, high water tables, persistent crawlspace humidity, and storm surge risks that require specialized restoration expertise. When water threatens your Mason Neck investment, you need professionals who understand waterfront property restoration. Flood Doctor has served Mason Neck's waterfront community for nearly two decades. We understand your neighborhood's tidal flooding patterns, the crawlspace moisture issues common in wooded lots backing to conservation areas, and the unique challenges of homes near Mason Neck State Park and Pohick Bay.",
      "Mason Neck water damage differs from other Lorton areas—high ambient humidity from water proximity, tidal backflow during storms, groundwater intrusion in crawlspaces, and environmental considerations for properties near the Potomac and wildlife refuge. Our restoration protocols account for these waterfront-specific conditions."

      question: "Why does my Mason Neck home always feel humid?",
      answer: "Waterfront proximity creates chronically high ambient humidity—especially in crawlspaces and basements. High water tables and proximity to the Potomac River mean moisture is constant. Permanent dehumidification is often necessary for comfort and mold prevention."

    },
    {
      question: "What about my crawlspace moisture problem?",
