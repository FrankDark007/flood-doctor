      "South County represents Lorton's suburban expansion—developed primarily from the 1980s-2000s with a mix of single-family homes and townhome communities. Your neighborhood faces water challenges from South Fairfax County's clay-heavy soil, storm drainage systems stressed by growth, and basement moisture issues common throughout the area. When water threatens your South County home, you need restoration experts who understand your neighborhood's specific challenges. Flood Doctor has served South County for nearly two decades. We've extracted water from flooded basements after storm drainage backups, dried homes affected by sump pump failures, and addressed the clay soil foundation seepage that affects properties throughout your area.",

    {
      question: "Why does my South County basement keep flooding?",
      answer: "Common causes include clay soil creating foundation pressure during wet seasons, sump pump failures during storms, or storm drainage backup when municipal systems are overwhelmed. We identify root causes and document for insurance while coordinating permanent solutions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with storm drain backup in my basement?",
      answer: "Yes. Storm drainage backup is common in South County during heavy rain. This is Category 2-3 contaminated water requiring sanitization protocols. We also document municipal system involvement for potential claims against Fairfax County."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my finished basement?",
      answer: "Finished basement flooding requires rapid professional response. We prioritize quick water extraction and controlled drying that saves flooring, drywall, and contents—but only if we respond within hours of flooding starting."
