  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "What should I do immediately after a fire in my Lorton home?",
      answer: "First, ensure the fire marshal has cleared the property for entry and utilities are safe. Don't attempt cleanup yourself—fire residue can be toxic. Call us immediately at (703) 656-0113 for emergency board-up and restoration. Contact your insurance company to report the fire and tell them we'll be providing the restoration estimate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can smoke damage affect rooms that didn't burn?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Smoke migrates throughout homes—especially in open floor plans common in Laurel Hill. Rooms far from actual fire can have extensive smoke and soot damage requiring professional cleaning. HVAC systems can distribute smoke to every room."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "Fire damage is typically fully covered by homeowners insurance including fire damage, smoke damage, firefighting water damage, temporary living expenses, and content restoration. We work directly with insurance adjusters and handle claim documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does fire restoration take?",
      answer: "Small fires (kitchen, single room) take 2-4 weeks for complete restoration. Larger fires requiring extensive reconstruction take 2-6 months depending on damage extent. We provide realistic timelines after assessment and can prioritize areas for faster partial occupancy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you remove smoke odors completely?",
      answer: "Yes. Complete smoke odor elimination requires proper cleaning, sealing of porous materials that absorbed smoke, HVAC cleaning, and professional deodorization using thermal fogging and hydroxyl generation. Rushing this process leaves lingering odors."
    },
    {
      question: "What about firefighting water damage?",
      answer: "We extract firefighting water immediately and dry structures before mold develops. Fire-damaged materials are especially vulnerable to mold—water extraction and drying happen simultaneously with fire restoration, not as an afterthought."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle both restoration and reconstruction?",
      answer: "Yes. We manage complete fire recovery from emergency board-up through final reconstruction. One company coordinates your entire restoration—we don't hand off reconstruction to separate contractors."
    },
    {
      question: "Can contents be saved after fire damage?",
      answer: "Many contents can be restored using specialized cleaning—ultrasonic cleaning, ozone treatment, and content restoration services. We assess each item and provide detailed inventory for insurance claims of both restorable and non-restorable contents."
