    paragraphs: [
      `When water invades your Lorton home, you need restoration experts who understand our unique community. Whether you're in a new construction townhome in Laurel Hill, a waterfront property along the Occoquan River, or an established single-family home in Gunston, water damage requires immediate professional response.

Flood Doctor has served Lorton's growing community for nearly two decades. We've extracted standing water from Laurel Hill's newest developments, dried crawlspaces in Mason Neck's wooded properties, and protected historic homes throughout Occoquan. When your South County neighbor recommends a water restoration company, they mention us—because we've already served their street.`,

      `Lorton's water damage challenges reflect our geographic diversity. The Occoquan River watershed creates higher flood risk during spring storms and tropical weather systems. Mason Neck's waterfront properties deal with tidal influences and high water tables that generic restoration companies don't understand. Laurel Hill's rapid development created drainage infrastructure that can be overwhelmed during exceptional rainfall events.

Our IICRC-certified technicians don't just extract water and leave. We understand that your new Laurel Hill townhome's modern building systems require different approaches than Occoquan's historic properties, that Mason Neck's crawlspace foundations need specialized moisture control, and that South County's clay soil creates unique foundation water intrusion patterns.`
    ],
    localContext: "Lorton spans new construction developments, established neighborhoods, and waterfront properties—each requiring specialized restoration expertise. We've protected investments throughout Laurel Hill, Mason Neck, Occoquan, South County, and Gunston since 2005."

        description: "Lorton's location within the Occoquan River watershed creates elevated flood risk during heavy rainfall and tropical storms. Properties near Mason Neck, Gunston Cove, and along the Occoquan River experience storm surge, tidal influences, and rapid water accumulation that overwhelm typical drainage systems.",

      },
      {
        title: "New Construction Drainage Failures",
        description: "Laurel Hill's rapid development during 2005-2020 created challenges: some properties have inadequate grading where contractors rushed site work, downspouts that discharge too close to foundations, and storm drainage infrastructure that becomes overwhelmed during exceptional rainfall events. Even homes less than 15 years old can experience basement flooding.",
        solution: "We address the immediate water damage while documenting drainage defects with photos and moisture mapping. For newer homes potentially covered by builder warranties, our detailed reports support claims against developers or builders."

        description: "Mason Neck and parts of Gunston feature heavily wooded lots backing to conservation areas. These properties battle persistent crawlspace humidity from poor air circulation, groundwater intrusion, and vapor transmission through soil—creating conditions where mold can establish even without acute flooding.",
        solution: "We use specialized crawlspace drying equipment including negative air machines and commercial dehumidifiers designed for these confined spaces. We also identify vapor barrier deficiencies and ventilation problems that contribute to chronic moisture."

        title: "Clay Soil Foundation Seepage",
        description: "South Fairfax County's clay-heavy soil expands dramatically when saturated, creating hydrostatic pressure against foundations. During wet seasons, this pressure forces water through foundation cracks, cold joints, and around basement windows—especially in older Gunston and South County properties.",
        solution: "While we dry your basement, we document all entry points using thermal imaging and moisture meters. This information helps foundation specialists design permanent solutions—exterior waterproofing, French drains, or crack injection systems."

        title: "Septic System Overflow",
        description: "Many older Lorton properties—particularly in Gunston and near Occoquan—operate on private septic systems rather than public sewer. When heavy rain saturates drain fields, these systems can back up into homes, creating Category 3 (black water) contamination requiring specialized cleanup protocols.",
        solution: "We're certified for all water categories including Category 3 biohazard cleanup. Our antimicrobial treatments and safe disposal protocols protect your family from sewage-related health risks while coordinating with septic specialists for system repairs."

      question: "How quickly should I call after discovering water damage in my Lorton home?",
      answer: "Immediately. Water damage worsens exponentially with every passing hour—water continues migrating into walls, under floors, and through ceiling spaces while mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours. In Lorton's humid climate, especially during summer months, the mold timeline can be even shorter. Call (703) 656-0113 the moment you discover water."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with flooding from the Occoquan River or tidal surge?",
      answer: "Yes. Waterfront property flooding is a specialty for Mason Neck and Occoquan River homes. We respond immediately to tidal surge events and have high-capacity extraction equipment for properties that experience recurring water intrusion from storm events and seasonal high water."
    },
    {
      question: "What about water damage in new Laurel Hill homes?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We've restored hundreds of newer Lorton properties and understand the specific challenges: inadequate grading, builder-grade waterproofing failures, and drainage infrastructure that wasn't designed for exceptional rainfall. For homes potentially under builder warranty, our detailed documentation supports claims against developers."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work directly with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We handle direct billing with all major carriers and provide comprehensive documentation—photos, moisture readings, daily monitoring logs, and detailed estimates—that insurance adjusters require. Our professional reports often improve claim outcomes for Lorton homeowners."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent mold after water damage?",
      answer: "Thorough drying within 24-48 hours prevents mold growth. We use industrial dehumidifiers and air movers to reduce moisture to safe levels (verified with both meters and thermal imaging), then monitor daily until complete drying is confirmed. Rushing the process or incomplete drying invites mold problems weeks or months later."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you dry crawlspaces under Mason Neck homes?",
      answer: "Yes. Crawlspace drying is a specialty for Lorton's wooded properties. We use negative air machines and commercial crawlspace dehumidifiers designed for confined spaces with limited access. We also identify vapor barrier problems and ventilation deficiencies that contribute to chronic moisture."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my septic system backed up into my home?",
      answer: "Septic backup is a Category 3 (black water) emergency requiring specialized cleanup protocols. We're certified for biohazard cleanup, including antimicrobial treatment, safe disposal, and odor elimination. Many older Gunston and Occoquan properties use septic—we coordinate with local septic specialists during restoration."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you serve Occoquan's historic downtown properties?",
      answer: "Definitely. Historic Occoquan properties require specialized care—we've restored homes dating to the 1700s-1800s with original wood flooring, plaster walls, and stone foundations. We use gentle drying methods that protect historic materials while thoroughly removing moisture to prevent rot and structural damage."
