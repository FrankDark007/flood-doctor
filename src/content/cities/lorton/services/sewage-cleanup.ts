      "Sewage backup in your Lorton home creates an immediate health emergency. Whether it's a septic system overflow on your Gunston property, sewer main backup in South County, storm drainage overwhelming your Laurel Hill basement, or septic failure at your historic Occoquan residence, sewage contamination requires professional biohazard response—not standard water damage cleanup. Flood Doctor provides 24/7 emergency sewage cleanup throughout Lorton. Our IICRC-certified biohazard technicians respond within 30 minutes equipped with protective gear, commercial sanitizers, and specialized disposal protocols required for Category 3 black water contamination.",
      "Lorton's sewage problems reflect our infrastructure diversity. Many older Gunston and Occoquan properties operate on private septic systems that can overflow when drain fields saturate during heavy rain. South County and Laurel Hill connect to public sewer but can experience backup when storm drainage overwhelms the system. Mason Neck's rural character means septic systems in areas where soil conditions create drainage challenges. Our crews understand Lorton's varied sewage infrastructure and apply appropriate cleanup protocols for each scenario."
    ],
    localContext: "Lorton sewage emergencies range from private septic overflow in Gunston and Occoquan to public sewer backup in South County to storm drain contamination throughout our community. We've handled every sewage scenario since 2005."

      "Material disposal volume—porous materials contacted by sewage require removal and proper disposal",
      "Source control—septic pumping/repair or plumbing work adds to total restoration cost",

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "What should I do immediately when sewage backs up into my Lorton home?",
      answer: "Evacuate affected areas immediately—sewage contains dangerous pathogens. Don't attempt cleanup yourself. Call us at (703) 656-0113 for emergency biohazard response. Don't let children or pets near contaminated areas. Turn off HVAC systems to prevent airborne contamination spread if sewage odors are present."
    },
    {
      question: "Is sewage cleanup different from regular water damage?",
      answer: "Completely different. Sewage is Category 3 black water—the most contaminated classification. It requires biohazard protocols: protective equipment, EPA-registered antimicrobials, proper material disposal, and health department coordination for significant events. Standard water damage protocols are inadequate and dangerous for sewage."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my Lorton septic system keep backing up?",
      answer: "Common causes include saturated drain fields during wet weather, failed tank components, tree root intrusion, or undersized systems for your household. Many Gunston and Occoquan properties have aging septic systems that need upgrading. We coordinate with septic specialists to identify and correct underlying problems."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover sewage backup in Lorton?",
      answer: "Standard homeowners policies often exclude sewer backup—requiring a separate sewage backup endorsement (typically $50-100 annually). Backup from private septic failures may be covered differently than municipal sewer backup. We work with carriers, document backup sources, and help establish coverage."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you respond to sewage emergencies at night?",
      answer: "Yes. Sewage contamination creates immediate health hazards requiring emergency response regardless of time. We provide true 24/7 biohazard response—when sewage backs up at 3 AM, our crews dispatch immediately with full protective gear and equipment."
    },
    {
      question: "What gets thrown away after sewage contamination?",
      answer: "All porous materials that contacted sewage must be disposed of: carpeting, padding, drywall, insulation, upholstered furniture, mattresses, and fabric items. Non-porous surfaces (tile, concrete, wood studs) can be sanitized and restored. We inventory all disposed items for insurance documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does sewage cleanup take?",
      answer: "Emergency cleanup and sanitization take 3-5 days. Material disposal and structural drying add another few days. Reconstruction (new drywall, flooring, etc.) takes 1-3 weeks depending on extent. We prioritize rapid sanitization to allow safe occupancy during reconstruction phase."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle sewage from storm drain backup?",
      answer: "Yes. Storm drain backup often brings sewage into basements during heavy rain when municipal systems overflow. This is Category 3 contamination requiring full biohazard protocols. We also document municipal system involvement for potential liability claims against Fairfax County."
