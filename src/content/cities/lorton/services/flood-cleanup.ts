    headline: "Expert Flood Response for Lorton's Waterfront Community",
    paragraphs: [
      \`Flooding in Lorton strikes from multiple sources—the Occoquan River overflowing its banks during tropical storms, Pohick Creek surging after spring downpours, storm drainage overwhelmed throughout South County, or tidal backflow affecting Mason Neck's waterfront properties. When floodwater enters your home, you need restoration experts who understand Lorton's unique flooding risks.

Flood Doctor has responded to every major flood event in Lorton for nearly two decades. We've cleaned up after tropical storm remnants flooded Occoquan River properties, extracted floodwater from Laurel Hill basements when storm drains backed up, and restored Mason Neck homes after tidal surge events. When Lorton floods, we're already positioned to respond.\`,

      \`Lorton's location within the Occoquan River watershed creates flood vulnerability that extends miles from actual waterfront. Heavy rainfall in upstream areas creates downstream flooding in our community hours later. Mason Neck's proximity to the Potomac means tidal influences during storm surge. South County's rapid development sometimes strains storm drainage beyond design capacity.

Our IICRC-certified flood restoration crews understand that floodwater isn't clean water—it's contaminated Category 2 or 3 water requiring specialized cleanup protocols to protect your family's health.\`
    ],
    localContext: "Lorton's flood risks range from Occoquan River overflow to tidal surge on Mason Neck to storm drainage backup throughout South County and Laurel Hill. We've restored flood-damaged homes throughout our watershed community since 2005."

    {
      question: "What should I do when floodwater enters my Lorton home?",
      answer: "First, ensure safety—don't enter floodwater if it might be electrically charged or deeper than a few inches. Move to higher ground if flooding is ongoing. Call us at (703) 656-0113 to report flooding and we'll dispatch immediately. Don't attempt cleanup yourself—floodwater contains contaminants requiring professional handling and protective equipment."
    },
    {
      question: "Is floodwater different from clean water damage?",
      answer: "Yes, critically different. Floodwater is Category 2 (grey water) or Category 3 (black water) depending on source—contaminated with bacteria, sewage, chemicals, and debris. It requires antimicrobial treatment and specialized disposal protocols. Clean water restoration protocols are inadequate and unsafe for flood cleanup."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flooding in Lorton?",
      answer: "Coverage depends on flood source. Homeowners insurance typically excludes rising water (river overflow, storm surge) which requires separate flood insurance. However, backup through drains may be covered. We work with both standard homeowners carriers and FEMA flood insurance, documenting everything for your claim."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle flood cleanup differently than water damage?",
      answer: "Flood cleanup requires contamination protocols: full hazmat protective gear for our crews, antimicrobial treatment of all contacted surfaces, safe disposal of porous materials that absorbed floodwater, air scrubbing to remove airborne contaminants, and verification that sanitization is complete before reconstruction. Standard water damage protocols don't address these health hazards."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you respond during active flooding?",
      answer: "Yes, when safe to do so. We respond during storm events and don't wait for water to recede. Early response means less total damage and faster recovery. Our crews work safely in flood conditions and coordinate with local authorities."
    },
    {
      question: "What about flooding from the Occoquan River?",
      answer: "Occoquan River flooding is a known risk for riverside Lorton properties and affects our entire watershed during exceptional events. We respond immediately to river flood events and understand the contamination protocols required for river water—which often contains sewage from upstream treatment overflow during storms."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take?",
      answer: "Extraction and content removal take 1-3 days. Structural drying takes 5-10 days depending on materials affected. Reconstruction (drywall, flooring, painting) adds 2-4 weeks. Flood cleanup takes longer than clean water damage due to disposal requirements and thorough sanitization protocols."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with FEMA for flood insurance claims?",
      answer: "Yes. We document flood damage according to FEMA requirements—flood depth marks, photos, affected material inventory, moisture documentation. We work with FEMA-participating flood insurance carriers and understand the National Flood Insurance Program claims process."
