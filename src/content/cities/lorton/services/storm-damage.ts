    paragraphs: [
      "Storm damage in Lorton arrives from multiple directions—tropical storm remnants bringing heavy rain and wind to the Occoquan River watershed, summer thunderstorms with damaging microbursts affecting South County, winter nor'easters creating ice damage throughout Laurel Hill, and severe weather that drops trees onto Mason Neck's wooded properties. When storms damage your home, you need emergency restoration experts who respond immediately regardless of weather conditions. Flood Doctor provides 24/7 storm damage response throughout Lorton. We've restored storm-damaged homes after every major weather event to hit our community—from tropical storm flooding along the Occoquan River to wind damage throughout South County to fallen trees crushing roofs in Mason Neck's wooded neighborhoods.",
      "Lorton's storm vulnerability reflects our geography. The Occoquan River watershed funnels heavy rainfall creating flash flooding miles from actual waterfront. Mason Neck and Gunston's mature tree canopy creates falling tree risks during high winds. South County and Laurel Hill's rapid development means newer roofs that can fail during severe weather. Our IICRC-certified storm restoration crews respond during active weather events—not after storms pass—to begin emergency mitigation immediately."
    ],
    localContext: "Lorton storm damage ranges from tropical storm flooding in the Occoquan watershed to wind damage throughout South County to tree impacts on Mason Neck's wooded properties. We've responded to every major storm event since 2005."

    {
      question: "Can you respond during active storms?",
      answer: "Yes, when safe to do so. We often respond during storms for emergency tarping and mitigation—preventing ongoing water intrusion while weather continues. Our crews work safely in severe weather conditions and coordinate with emergency services."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do immediately after storm damage?",
      answer: "First ensure safety—don't enter structurally damaged areas. If safe, place buckets under active roof leaks and move valuables from affected areas. Call us immediately at (703) 656-0113—we respond during and after storms. Take photos for insurance but don't delay calling for emergency mitigation."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover storm damage in Lorton?",
      answer: "Most homeowners policies cover wind damage, roof damage, and resulting water intrusion from storms. However, flood insurance is required for rising water (Occoquan River overflow). We work with both homeowners and flood insurance carriers, documenting all damage for your claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle fallen trees on homes?",
      answer: "We coordinate licensed tree removal while simultaneously providing emergency tarping to stop water intrusion. Tree removal, roof repair, and water damage restoration are all coordinated through our response—one company handles your complete storm recovery."
    },
    {
      question: "What about power outages affecting my basement?",
      answer: "We bring portable generators to power sump pumps and water extraction equipment when utility power is unavailable. We also assess secondary damage from sump pump failures during outages and document for insurance claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does storm damage restoration take?",
      answer: "Emergency mitigation (tarping, water extraction) happens day 1. Structural drying takes 3-7 days. Reconstruction (roofing, siding, interior repairs) takes 2-6 weeks depending on damage extent and material availability. We provide realistic timelines after assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle storm flooding from the Occoquan River?",
      answer: "Yes. Tropical storm events often cause Occoquan River and watershed flooding throughout Lorton. We respond with flood cleanup protocols (often Category 2-3 water requiring sanitization) and work with both homeowners and flood insurance carriers."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes you different during storm emergencies?",
