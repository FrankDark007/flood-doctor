    introduction: `Reston is defined by its townhome communities—from the original Reston developments to newer construction in Town Center and beyond. Townhome living offers community and convenience, but water damage in townhomes presents unique challenges: multi-level construction, shared walls, HOA involvement, and complex insurance situations.

This guide helps Reston townhome owners understand these dynamics and respond effectively when water damage occurs.`,

        heading: "Why Townhome Water Damage Is Different",
        content: `Townhomes present specific water damage challenges:

**Multi-level construction:**
Water on an upper level travels down through floors, walls, and chases. A bathroom overflow on the third floor can damage the second floor ceiling, first floor walls, and basement—all from a single incident.

**Shared walls:**
Water in your townhome can affect your neighbor. Conversely, your neighbor's water issue can flood into your unit. Shared walls complicate both response and responsibility.

**HOA involvement:**
Townhome communities have HOAs that:
- May own some components (roofs, exterior walls)
- Have insurance that covers certain damage
- May require specific contractors or approvals
- Create an additional layer of coordination

**Insurance complexity:**
Multiple insurance policies are often involved:
- Your HO-6 or HO-3 policy
- HOA master policy
- Neighbor's policy (if water originated there)
- Liability questions when you cause neighbor damage

**Limited access:**
Unlike single-family homes:
- You may not control exterior drainage
- Roof issues require HOA involvement
- Some repairs need neighbor cooperation
- Emergency access may be complicated`

        heading: "Common Townhome Water Sources",
        content: `Certain water damage sources are especially common in townhomes:

**Upper-level bathroom failures:**
Toilets, supply lines, and shower pans on upper levels create maximum damage when they fail—water travels through every level below.

*Prevention:* Replace supply lines regularly, inspect toilet components, address leaks immediately.

**Washing machine issues:**
In-unit laundry, common in Reston townhomes, creates significant risk:
- Hose failures release water continuously until discovered
- Upper-level laundry multiplies damage
- Drain backups flood utility areas

*Prevention:* Braided stainless steel hoses, turn off supply when not using, don't run when away.

**HVAC condensate:**
Many townhomes have HVAC equipment in attics or closets:
- Clogged condensate lines overflow
- Damage spreads before discovery
- Can affect multiple levels

*Prevention:* Annual HVAC service including condensate line cleaning.

**Roof and flashing failures:**
Townhome roofs are often HOA-maintained:
- Delayed maintenance creates leaks
- Interior damage may occur before exterior issues are visible
- Ice dams in winter can cause water entry

*Response:* Report issues to HOA immediately, document interior damage.

**Shared plumbing failures:**
Townhomes may share some plumbing infrastructure:
- Main line failures affect multiple units
- Sewer backups can enter through lowest unit
- Pressure issues affect connected units

*Response:* Contact HOA and neighbors, determine scope of issue.`
