    introduction: `From the planned community's townhomes and condos to the single-family neighborhoods of North Hills and South Lakes, Reston properties face water damage from various sources—burst pipes, appliance failures, storm events, and plumbing problems. When water floods your Reston home, your response in the first hour determines whether you face a manageable cleanup or a major restoration project.

This guide provides the step-by-step response every Reston homeowner should know.`,

        heading: "First 5 Minutes: Safety and Shutoff",
        content: `**Safety is the first priority.**
- Ensure everyone is accounted for
- Keep children and pets away from water
- Don't enter water if you suspect electrical hazard

**Stop the water source:**

*If you can identify the source:*
- Under-sink leak: Close the hot and cold valves under the sink
- Toilet overflow: Close the valve behind the toilet
- Washing machine: Close supply valves behind the machine
- Water heater: Close the cold water inlet valve
- Appliance failure: Locate the appliance supply valve

*If you can't identify the source or stop it:*
Turn off your main water shutoff:
- Most Reston single-family homes: in basement near where water line enters
- Townhomes: often near the water heater or in a utility closet
- Condos: typically in a utility closet or behind an access panel

**Know your shutoff location now.** Find it today, before you need it in an emergency.

**Electrical safety:**
- If water is near electrical outlets, panels, or appliances, turn off power at the breaker
- Never enter standing water when electricity may be present
- If your breaker panel is in or near water, do not approach it—call an electrician`

        heading: "Minutes 5-15: Damage Control",
        content: `**While waiting for professional help, minimize damage:**

*Move what you can:*
- Lift furniture onto blocks or foil (prevents staining)
- Move electronics to dry areas
- Remove area rugs from wet floors
- Empty lower cabinets and closet floors
- Relocate documents and photos

*Slow the spread:*
- Use towels along doorways as barriers
- Mop up accessible water
- Place containers under active drips
- Open interior doors for air circulation

*Document everything:*
- Take photos and video before cleanup
- Document water levels and affected areas
- Photograph the source if visible
- Note the time of discovery

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't use household fans to "dry" significant water (can spread moisture into walls)
- Don't use a regular vacuum on water
- Don't assume wet carpet will dry on its own
- Don't wait to see if it gets worse
- Don't try to remove wet carpet without proper equipment`

        heading: "Reston-Specific Considerations",
        content: `Reston's housing stock creates specific water damage patterns:

**Townhomes (common in Reston):**
- Multi-level construction means water travels between floors
- Shared walls may mean neighbor's water affects you
- HOA involvement for exterior and some interior damage
- Finished basements at risk during heavy rain

**Condos and apartments:**
- Water from your unit can affect units below
- You may be liable for damage to neighbors
- Building management involvement required
- Multiple insurance policies in play

**Single-family homes (North Hills, South Lakes, etc.):**
- Full responsibility for response
- Basements common and at risk
- Older neighborhoods may have aging plumbing
- Crawlspaces can conceal water damage

**Planned community factors:**
- Mature landscaping can affect drainage
- Common area water issues may require RA involvement
- Storm water management systems may be overtaxed
- Some areas have higher water tables

**Reston Town Center area:**
- Mixed-use buildings with commercial considerations
- High-rise logistics apply
- Building management coordination required
- Business interruption concerns for commercial tenants`

        heading: "Common Reston Water Damage Causes",
        content: `Understanding common causes helps with prevention:

**Supply line failures:**
Flexible supply lines under sinks and behind toilets are the most common failure point. They deteriorate with age and can release water for hours before discovery.

*Prevention:* Replace every 5-7 years with braided stainless steel.

**Washing machine hose failures:**
Rubber hoses deteriorate and burst catastrophically. In-unit laundry in townhomes and condos makes this especially common.

*Prevention:* Use braided stainless steel hoses, turn off supply when not in use.

**Water heater failures:**
Tank water heaters fail after 10-15 years, releasing 40-80 gallons plus continuous flow. Many Reston homes have original or aging water heaters.

*Prevention:* Replace proactively, install drip pan with alarm.

**Sump pump failures:**
Reston properties with basements rely on sump pumps. Failures during storms cause immediate flooding.

*Prevention:* Battery backup, regular testing, proactive replacement.

**Storm-related flooding:**
Reston's wooded areas and drainage patterns create flooding risk during heavy storms. Basement flooding is common during major rain events.

*Prevention:* Proper grading, gutter maintenance, sump pump reliability.

**HVAC condensate issues:**
Clogged condensate lines cause overflow into living spaces, sometimes into attics or ceilings where damage spreads before discovery.

*Prevention:* Annual HVAC maintenance including condensate line clearing.`
