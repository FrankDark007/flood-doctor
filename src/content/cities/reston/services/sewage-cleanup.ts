    paragraphs: [
      `Few emergencies create more urgent health hazards than sewage backup. When raw sewage floods into your Reston basement through floor drains—backing up from overtaxed sewer lines or during severe storms—every minute of exposure increases contamination spread. Your finished basement, the family room where your children play, the walkout space facing Reston's natural areas—now contaminated with Category 3 biohazardous waste.

Flood Doctor maintains biohazard certification specifically for these emergencies. We've cleaned up sewage backups throughout Reston: storm-overwhelmed sewer lines in Hunters Woods, drain backups in South Lakes colonials, and system failures in Lake Anne Village's older infrastructure. When sewage invades your planned community home, we arrive with the PPE, antimicrobial treatments, and disposal protocols the situation demands.`,

      `Reston faces sewage risks during severe storms. The community's stormwater management directs significant runoff through the system, and extreme rainfall can overwhelm capacity. Older neighborhoods like Lake Anne Village and Hickory Cluster have aging sewer infrastructure approaching 60 years. Townhomes with lower-level bathrooms face backup risk when main lines are stressed.

Our crews don't approach sewage like regular water damage. This is biohazard work requiring specialized training, protective equipment, and disposal procedures that ensure your family's safety—and in Reston's cluster housing, potentially your neighbors' safety too.`
    ],
    localContext: "Reston's sewer infrastructure varies by age and location. Original 1960s clusters have older systems more vulnerable to failure, while newer developments connect to more modern infrastructure. Both face backup risk during extreme storms."

    {
      question: "Is sewage backup dangerous to my family?",
      answer: "Yes—sewage contains bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause serious illness. Do not enter contaminated areas, don't attempt cleanup yourself, and keep children and pets away. Call professionals immediately. The longer sewage sits, the more dangerous it becomes and the further contamination spreads."
    },
    {
      question: "What gets thrown away after sewage backup?",
      answer: "Porous materials that absorbed sewage must be disposed of as biohazard waste: carpet, padding, drywall below the contamination line, upholstered furniture, mattresses, and similar items. Hard surfaces like tile, concrete, and sealed wood can often be decontaminated and saved."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover sewage backup?",
      answer: "Most homeowner policies offer sewer backup coverage, either included or as an endorsement. Check your policy or call your agent. We document everything for claims, photograph damage, and provide detailed reports. If you're unsure about coverage, we can help you understand your policy."
    },
    {
      question: "If my townhome has sewage backup, could it affect my neighbors?",
      answer: "In Reston's cluster housing, some units share sewer connections. Backup in one unit may indicate a shared-line problem. We assess whether neighboring units face risk and recommend they check their lower-level drains. Coordinated cleanup prevents the problem from bouncing between connected units."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until my basement is safe after sewage cleanup?",
      answer: "Proper decontamination takes 5-7 days: extraction, material removal, antimicrobial treatment, drying, and verification. We don't declare spaces safe until treatment is complete and verified. For Reston families with health-sensitive members, this thoroughness matters."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does sewage back up during storms in Reston?",
      answer: "Reston's stormwater and sewer systems handle significant volume, but extreme storms can exceed capacity. Heavy rainfall overwhelms the system, causing backup through the lowest drains—typically basement floor drains. Older clusters with aging infrastructure are more vulnerable than newer developments."
