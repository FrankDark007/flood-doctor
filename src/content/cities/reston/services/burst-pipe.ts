    headline: "Emergency Burst Pipe Response for Reston Homes",
    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe releases 400-600 gallons of water per hour into your Reston home. Within the time it takes to drive home from the Wiehle-Reston East Metro, a failed supply line can flood your entire lower level. In a townhome, that water travels through party walls to your neighbors' units. The finished basement where your family gathers, the home office where you work remotely—underwater because of a quarter-inch crack in a copper line.

Flood Doctor has responded to burst pipe emergencies throughout Reston for nearly two decades. We've extracted water from Lake Anne Village townhomes at 3 AM, dried the walkout basements of North Point colonials after supply line failures, and restored Hunters Woods properties following winter freeze damage. When pipes burst in Reston—and they burst every winter—our crews are positioned within minutes of your door.`,

      `Reston's pipe failures follow predictable patterns. Winter freezes catch exterior hose bibs, attic supply lines, and the pipes in unheated spaces of townhome construction. Summer brings pressurized supply line failures, often inside wall cavities where they flood for hours before detection. The original Lake Anne Village and Hickory Cluster properties—built in the 1960s—have aging copper and galvanized plumbing that fails more frequently than modern PEX systems.

We coordinate water shutoff, extract standing water, and begin drying before a plumber even arrives. In Reston's townhomes, we also assess party walls for moisture migration—because your pipe burst could become your neighbor's mold problem.`

    localContext: "Reston's diverse housing—from original 1960s townhomes to contemporary condos—means pipe failures occur in varied configurations. Cluster housing with shared walls requires additional attention to prevent water damage from spreading between units."

    headline: "Burst Pipes in Reston Townhomes & Cluster Housing",
    content: `Reston's innovative cluster housing—townhomes sharing walls, common areas, and sometimes plumbing—creates unique burst pipe scenarios. When a pipe bursts in your unit, water can travel through party walls, down through floor assemblies, and into neighboring homes. What starts as your emergency becomes a community issue.

We're experienced in Reston's cluster housing dynamics. After addressing your immediate emergency, we assess party walls using thermal imaging. If moisture has migrated, we contact affected neighbors before mold has time to develop. We coordinate with HOAs when multiple units require restoration, handling the communication and documentation that cluster living requires.

Our goal is complete restoration across all affected units—preventing the disputes, mold problems, and long-term damage that incomplete restoration creates in shared-wall housing.`,

      question: "What should I do first when a pipe bursts in my Reston home?",
      answer: "Shut off the main water supply immediately—this stops water flow while you call for help. If you can't find the shutoff or it's stuck, call us at (703) 656-0107 anyway—we can guide you and are dispatching simultaneously. Turn off electricity to affected areas if water is near outlets or panels."
    },
    {
      question: "If I live in a townhome, could my burst pipe affect my neighbors?",
      answer: "Yes. Water travels through party walls, shared foundations, and floor assemblies in Reston's cluster housing. We assess shared walls with thermal imaging and coordinate with affected neighbors. Early detection prevents your emergency from becoming a community problem."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do pipes burst more in older Reston clusters?",
      answer: "Lake Anne Village, Hickory Cluster, and other original developments have plumbing approaching 60 years old. Copper corrodes internally over decades, creating weak points that fail without warning. Original insulation may also have settled, exposing pipes to freeze risk."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call a plumber or water damage company first?",
      answer: "Call us first—we respond faster, can begin extraction while the plumber repairs, and coordinate the entire process. We have relationships with Reston plumbers and can recommend reliable emergency plumbing. Our goal is getting water out before it spreads further or reaches neighbors' units."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover burst pipe damage?",
      answer: "Yes, most homeowner policies cover sudden pipe failures and resulting water damage. Gradual leaks from maintenance neglect may have limitations. We document everything for your claim, photograph damage, log moisture readings, and provide the detailed reports adjusters need."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you prevent mold after a burst pipe?",
      answer: "With fast response and proper drying, yes. Mold needs 24-48 hours of moisture to begin growing. We extract water immediately, deploy industrial drying equipment, and monitor moisture levels until materials return to normal. In Reston townhomes, we ensure party walls are completely dry to prevent hidden mold growth."
