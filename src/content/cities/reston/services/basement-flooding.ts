    paragraphs: [
      `Basement flooding in Reston follows predictable patterns tied directly to the community's planned design. Homes backing to Lake Anne, South Lakes, and Lake Newport face seasonal groundwater rises that push water through foundation walls and floor slabs—not from surface drainage problems, but from hydrostatic pressure created by the rising water table. Properties in Hunters Woods and North Point with wooded lots experience different basement moisture issues: soil saturated from heavy tree cover stays wet longer, creating persistent seepage that townhomes on cleared lots never face.

Flood Doctor has restored flooded basements throughout Reston's neighborhoods since 2005. We've extracted thousands of gallons from South Lakes finished basements during spring floods, dried Lake Anne properties affected by seasonal water table fluctuations, and addressed wooded lot moisture intrusion in Hunters Woods clusters. When your North Point neighbor's sump pump fails during a weekend storm, they call us—because we understand the specific flooding patterns affecting each Reston neighborhood.`,

      `Reston's diverse basement types require different restoration approaches. The finished lower levels in South Lakes single-family homes—complete with rec rooms, guest bedrooms, and full bathrooms—demand careful material protection during drying. Garden-style condo clusters in Hunters Woods have below-grade storage areas shared between units, requiring coordination with your HOA. The high-rise buildings near Reston Town Center feature underground parking and mechanical rooms where flooding affects entire building systems, not just individual units.

Our IICRC-certified crews don't just pump water and leave. We identify why your basement flooded—failed sump pump, overwhelmed perimeter drainage, groundwater intrusion, or surface water infiltration—then address both the immediate damage and prevent recurrence. Your Lake Anne village townhome requires different expertise than a South Lakes detached home on a wooded lot, and we deliver both with equal proficiency.`
    ],
    localContext: "Reston's lakefront properties, wooded lots, and planned drainage systems create unique basement flooding patterns. We've mastered restoration for every scenario: seasonal lake area groundwater rises, wooded lot persistent moisture, cluster drainage failures, and sump pump emergencies."

      question: "Why does my lakefront Reston basement flood every spring?",
      answer: "Homes near Lake Anne, South Lakes, and Lake Newport experience seasonal water table rises. Spring rains and snowmelt raise groundwater levels, creating hydrostatic pressure that pushes water through basement foundation walls and floor slabs. This is groundwater intrusion, not surface drainage—and requires interior drainage systems or exterior waterproofing to prevent."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save carpet and drywall after basement flooding?",
      answer: "It depends on water category and saturation duration. Clean water from sump failures can often be dried if we respond within 24-48 hours. Sewage-contaminated water requires material removal. We assess each situation individually and recommend the safest, most cost-effective approach based on IICRC standards."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my sump pump failed and caused the flooding?",
      answer: "We extract water immediately, dry your basement completely, and inspect the sump system. Failed pumps due to age or lack of maintenance are documented for insurance. We can recommend sump pump specialists who install upgraded systems with battery backup and WiFi monitoring."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle basement flooding in townhome clusters?",
      answer: "We assess whether flooding affected only your unit or multiple cluster homes through shared foundation walls. Using thermal imaging, we detect moisture migration to neighboring units—then coordinate with your HOA to address all affected properties simultaneously for consistent restoration quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover basement flooding restoration?",
      answer: "Most homeowner policies cover sudden failures like burst pipes and sump malfunctions. Gradual seepage and groundwater intrusion may not be covered. We document everything and work directly with your insurance adjuster to support claim approval for covered damage."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does basement drying take in Reston's humid climate?",
      answer: "Typically 4-7 days with industrial equipment. Reston's wooded neighborhoods create high ambient humidity that slows drying—especially during summer months when outdoor humidity exceeds 70%. We use low-grain dehumidifiers that overcome these challenging conditions, unlike consumer equipment that can't handle Reston's climate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you prevent my basement from flooding again?",
      answer: "We identify the flooding cause and recommend permanent solutions. Sump pump failures need upgraded systems. Surface water needs grading improvements. Groundwater intrusion requires interior drainage or exterior waterproofing. We partner with specialists who implement these long-term solutions after emergency restoration."
