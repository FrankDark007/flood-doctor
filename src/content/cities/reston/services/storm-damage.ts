    paragraphs: [
      \`When severe weather crosses Fairfax County, Reston's integration with natural areas creates compound damage scenarios. The mature trees along the 55+ miles of pathways can drop limbs onto roofs, crash through fences, or topple onto the power lines that serve cluster housing. Add wind-driven rain, hail damage, and overwhelmed stormwater systems, and a single storm can create multiple damage types across Reston's diverse housing stock.

Flood Doctor responds to storm damage throughout Reston within 30 minutes of safe travel conditions. We've tarped roofs in Hunters Woods during active weather, extracted storm water from South Lakes basements, and coordinated tree removal with restoration at North Point properties. Storm damage requires rapid response to prevent secondary water damage—every hour a compromised roof leaks, restoration costs climb.\`,

      \`Reston's storm damage differs from typical suburban properties. Townhomes with shared roofs mean one unit's damage can affect neighbors. The pathway system's mature trees create debris impact risk throughout the community. Walkout basements facing natural areas receive concentrated runoff during heavy storms.

We coordinate all aspects of storm restoration: emergency tarping, water extraction, structural drying, debris removal coordination, and insurance documentation. One call handles everything—from the moment the storm passes until your planned community home is restored.\`

    headline: "Storm Damage in Reston Townhomes & Cluster Housing",
    content: \`Reston's cluster housing adds complexity to storm damage restoration. When storms damage shared roofing, party walls, or common areas, the situation involves multiple homeowners, HOAs, and sometimes the Reston Association.

**Shared Roof Damage:** Many Reston townhomes share roofing assemblies. When a tree limb penetrates the roof above one unit, water can travel to affect neighbors. We assess all connected units and coordinate with all affected homeowners.

**HOA Coordination:** Cluster associations often have authority over exterior repairs. We understand Reston's governance structure and can expedite emergency approvals while providing documentation that satisfies association requirements.

**Common Area Damage:** Storm damage to cluster common areas—pathways, landscaping, shared structures—may require Reston Association involvement. We coordinate with property managers when restoration affects common elements.

Our goal is complete restoration with proper coordination—protecting your unit while respecting the planned community structure that makes Reston unique.\`,

      question: "When should I call after storm damage?",
      answer: "Call immediately once it's safe. Even if you're not sure about damage extent, early assessment and emergency tarping prevent secondary water damage. We respond to Reston calls within 30 minutes of safe travel conditions—often while rain is still falling."
    },

      question: "A tree fell on my Reston townhome. What do I do?",
      answer: "Evacuate if structural integrity is questionable, then call us. For townhomes, also alert your attached neighbors if the tree affects shared structures. We assess safety, coordinate tree removal, provide emergency weatherproofing, and handle resulting water and structural damage."
    },
    {
      question: "If storm damage affects my townhome's shared roof, who pays?",
      answer: "This depends on your HOA's governing documents. Generally, the HOA maintains shared roofing, but water damage inside your unit is your responsibility. We can help you navigate this while restoration proceeds—our documentation supports both individual claims and HOA claims."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call my insurance company or you first?",
      answer: "Call us first—we can begin emergency services and documentation immediately. Notify your insurance company soon after, but don't wait for their approval before emergency weatherproofing. Preventing additional damage protects your claim and your property."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have hidden storm damage?",
      answer: "After storms, inspect attics for daylight (indicating roof damage), check basements for water entry, look for ceiling stains or wet walls, and examine exterior siding. For townhomes, coordinate with neighbors to check shared attic spaces. Professional assessment catches damage you might miss."
    },
    {
      question: "What if another storm comes before repairs are complete?",
      answer: "Our emergency tarping and board-up services provide weatherproofing until permanent repairs occur. We use quality materials designed to withstand additional weather. If another storm causes additional damage to temporarily protected areas, we address it promptly."
