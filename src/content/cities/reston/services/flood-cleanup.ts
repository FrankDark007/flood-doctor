    paragraphs: [
      `Summer storms roll through Northern Virginia with little warning. One moment your North Point colonial is peaceful; an hour later, six inches of rain has overwhelmed the stormwater system, raised the water table near Lake Audubon, and sent muddy water cascading into your walkout basement. The family room facing the nature preserve, the home office where you work remotely—now under brown water carried by the very natural integration that makes Reston special.

Flood Doctor has cleaned up after every major storm event in Reston since 2005. We've pumped out lake-adjacent basements after flash floods, extracted storm water from Hunters Woods colonials, and restored South Lakes properties after summer deluges. When NOAA issues a flash flood warning for Fairfax County, our phones light up with Reston addresses—and our trucks are already positioned to respond.`,

      `Flood cleanup in Reston differs from typical water damage. Storm water carries soil from the pathways, debris from natural areas, and contaminants that complicate restoration. Reston's unique hydrology—four man-made lakes, extensive stormwater management, and homes integrated with nature—means flood water often carries sediment from the community's natural areas. Properties near Lake Anne or Lake Thoreau may also experience groundwater flooding when the water table rises during extended storms.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand Reston's flood patterns: the low-lying areas where stormwater collects, the walkout basements vulnerable to runoff, the lake-adjacent properties where groundwater rises during wet periods. We don't just pump and leave—we extract, decontaminate, and restore.`

    localContext: "Reston's integration with natural areas and four lakes creates flood risks unique to the planned community. Properties near water features, in natural drainage paths, or at lower elevations face higher exposure during severe storms."

    content: `Robert E. Simon's vision placed Reston homes in harmony with four man-made lakes—Lake Anne, Lake Thoreau, Lake Audubon, and Lake Newport. This creates beautiful neighborhoods and elevated flood risk. Properties near the lakes experience:

**Higher Water Tables:** Groundwater sits closer to basement floors year-round. During wet periods, it rises into basements through cracks, floor joints, and wall/floor connections—even without rainfall.

**Runoff Collection:** Storm water flows toward the lakes from surrounding areas. Properties on these flow paths receive concentrated runoff during storms.

**Extended Saturation:** Lake-adjacent soil stays saturated longer after storms, extending the period of elevated groundwater and prolonging drying times for affected basements.

We understand these dynamics because we've served lake-area properties throughout Reston's history. Our drying approaches account for higher ambient humidity, and we can recommend long-term solutions for chronic groundwater issues.`,

      question: "Should I wait until the storm passes to call for flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Call immediately, even during the storm. We dispatch when it's safe to travel—often before rain fully stops. Earlier calls mean earlier response times. Standing flood water continues damaging your Reston home every hour it remains. Our crews know Reston's roads and can reach your property as soon as conditions allow."
    },
    {
      question: "Is flood water from a storm contaminated?",
      answer: "Almost always yes. Reston's storm water carries pathway soil, natural area debris, and bacteria as it flows through the community. If it mixed with sewage backup—common during heavy storms—it's Category 3 biohazard. We assess contamination level and apply appropriate protocols. Don't wade through flood water without protection."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flood damage from a storm?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance typically covers storm damage, including water intrusion from overwhelmed drainage, window well flooding, and sump pump failure. Separate flood insurance may be needed for rising water events near the lakes. We document everything for your claim and work directly with adjusters."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take in a Reston home?",
      answer: "Initial water extraction takes hours; complete drying takes 5-10 days depending on property location and materials. Lake-adjacent properties may require 7-10 days due to higher ambient humidity. We provide daily updates and realistic timelines based on your specific situation."
    },
    {
      question: "My home is near Lake Anne—is flooding more of a risk?",
      answer: "Yes. Lake-adjacent properties experience higher water tables, concentrated runoff, and longer soil saturation. We understand these dynamics and adjust our approach accordingly—extended drying times, groundwater intrusion assessment, and recommendations for long-term solutions when appropriate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my belongings be saved after flooding?",
      answer: "Many items can be cleaned and restored. We assess each item, separate salvageable from unsalvageable, and provide content cleaning services. Porous materials that absorbed contaminated water—like upholstered furniture in Category 3 flooding—typically require disposal for health reasons."
