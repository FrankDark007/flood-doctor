    headline: "Professional Fire & Smoke Damage Restoration for Reston Homes",
    paragraphs: [
      \`After firefighters leave your Reston property, the real restoration challenge begins. The fire may be out, but smoke has penetrated every room, soot coats surfaces far from the flames, and water from suppression efforts saturates floors and walls. Your South Lakes colonial or Lake Anne townhome—with its finished spaces and carefully maintained interiors—now requires specialized restoration that most companies aren't equipped to provide.

Flood Doctor has restored fire-damaged properties throughout Reston for nearly two decades. We've removed soot from Hunters Woods kitchens, eliminated smoke odor from North Point colonials, and dried fire suppression water from walkout basements facing Reston's natural areas. Fire damage restoration combines smoke and soot cleaning, odor elimination, water damage restoration, and content cleaning—we handle all of it.\`,

      \`Reston's diverse housing presents unique fire restoration challenges. Townhomes with party walls mean smoke and odor can migrate to neighbors' units. Cluster housing shares HVAC systems that spread contamination. Condos in Reston Town Center require coordination with building management and adjacent units. The planned community's interconnected design adds complexity that standalone homes don't face.

We respond within hours of fire department clearance, beginning the restoration process while damage is still fresh. Early intervention saves more of your property—soot continues etching surfaces and smoke odor sets deeper every day.\`

    localContext: "Reston's townhomes, cluster housing, and condos create fire restoration challenges beyond typical residential work. Party wall concerns, shared HVAC, and neighbor coordination require expertise in the planned community's unique structure."

  townhomeFireConcerns: {
    headline: "Fire Damage in Reston Townhomes & Cluster Housing",
    content: \`Fire in attached housing creates concerns beyond the affected unit. Reston's townhomes and cluster housing share walls, attic spaces, and sometimes HVAC systems—all pathways for smoke, soot, and odor to migrate.

**Smoke Migration:** Even contained fires produce smoke that travels through party walls, shared attics, and connected ductwork. Neighbors may experience smoke odor and soot deposits without visible fire damage.

**Structural Connections:** Fire weakening structural members in one unit can affect the stability of attached homes. We assess not just your unit but the integrity of shared structural elements.

**HVAC Contamination:** Cluster housing with shared HVAC systems can distribute smoke throughout multiple units before anyone realizes the extent of contamination. Complete restoration often requires coordinated HVAC cleaning.

**HOA Coordination:** Fire damage affecting shared structures, roofing, or common areas requires HOA involvement. We understand Reston's governance and coordinate approvals while restoration proceeds.

We approach townhome fires with full awareness of neighbor impact—assessing party walls, checking adjacent units, and coordinating with affected homeowners for complete restoration.\`,

      question: "When can you start fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "We respond within hours of fire department clearance. The fire department must release the property first—usually after investigation. Call us as soon as the fire is out; we'll coordinate timing and arrive as soon as we're permitted access."
    },
    {
      question: "If my Reston townhome had a fire, could it affect my neighbors?",
      answer: "Yes. Smoke travels through party walls, shared attics, and connected HVAC systems. Even if fire was contained to your unit, neighbors may have smoke odor and soot deposits. We assess all connected units and coordinate restoration when multiple homes are affected."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is fast response important after a fire?",
      answer: "Soot is acidic and continues etching surfaces every day. Smoke odor sets deeper into porous materials over time. Water from suppression efforts can cause mold growth within 24-48 hours—especially in Reston's humid environment. Early intervention saves more of your property."
    },
    {
      question: "Can smoke odor really be eliminated?",
      answer: "Yes, with professional treatment. We use thermal fogging, hydroxyl generators, and ozone treatments to eliminate odor at the molecular level—not just mask it. For Reston townhomes, we ensure odor is addressed in your unit before it migrates to neighbors."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my personal belongings after a fire?",
      answer: "We inventory, clean, and restore salvageable items. Electronics receive specialized cleaning, fabrics are ozone-treated, hard items are ultrasonically cleaned. Items that can't be restored are documented for insurance. Your belongings receive individual attention."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "Yes—fire damage is a standard covered peril in homeowner's policies. We work directly with insurance adjusters, document all damage and restoration efforts, and support your claim throughout the process."
