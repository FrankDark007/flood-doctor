    paragraphs: [
      `That musty smell in your South Lakes basement isn't just unpleasant—it's a warning sign of mold growth that may have spread far beyond what you can see. Reston's integration with lakes and natural areas creates higher humidity conditions that accelerate mold growth. Your lake-adjacent townhome, your North Point colonial backing to preserved woodlands, or your walkout basement facing natural areas all face elevated mold risk compared to typical Virginia homes.

Flood Doctor's IICRC-certified mold remediation technicians have cleared mold from Reston properties for nearly two decades. We've remediated hidden growth in Lake Anne Village townhomes, eliminated mold colonies behind the walls of Hunters Woods colonials, and restored healthy air quality in properties where previous water damage went unaddressed. Mold doesn't respect Robert E. Simon's vision—your planned community home is vulnerable like any other.`,

      `Reston's mold challenges stem from its unique design. Properties near the four lakes experience higher ambient humidity year-round. Walkout basements facing natural areas trap moisture. Townhome construction with shared walls can spread mold from neglected units to well-maintained neighbors. Large HVAC systems spread spores throughout homes before anyone notices the source.

We don't simply spray bleach and hope for the best. Professional mold remediation requires containment, HEPA filtration, source elimination, surface treatment, and verification testing. For Reston homeowners with health concerns, real estate transactions pending, or visible mold growth, proper remediation protects both health and property value.`

Reston's diverse housing—townhomes, colonials, condos—each present different challenges. Lake-adjacent properties may require additional moisture control. We provide detailed estimates after assessment.",

      question: "How do I know if I have a mold problem in my Reston home?",
      answer: "Warning signs include musty odors, visible discoloration on walls or ceilings, water stains, condensation on windows, and unexplained respiratory symptoms that improve when you're away from home. Reston's lake-adjacent homes and walkout basements often hide mold behind walls—if you had water damage that wasn't professionally dried, mold may have developed unseen."
    },
    {
      question: "Is mold more common in Reston than other areas?",
      answer: "Reston's integration with lakes and natural areas creates higher ambient humidity than typical Virginia developments. Properties near Lake Anne, Lake Thoreau, Lake Audubon, and Lake Newport face elevated mold risk. Walkout basements facing natural areas and townhome construction with party walls also create unique mold vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "Can mold spread from a neighboring townhome to mine?",
      answer: "Yes. In Reston's cluster housing, mold can spread through party walls. If a neighboring unit has unaddressed water damage or mold, spores can migrate through shared walls, attic spaces, and common areas. This is why we always assess party walls during townhome remediation."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold come back after remediation?",
      answer: "Not if the moisture source is corrected. Mold requires moisture to grow—eliminate the water problem and mold won't return. For Reston's lake-adjacent properties, this often means installing or upgrading dehumidification systems to manage higher ambient humidity."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does mold remediation take?",
      answer: "Most residential projects take 3-7 days depending on scope. Reston townhomes requiring party wall attention or larger colonials with extensive growth may take longer. Testing results take 2-3 additional days. We provide realistic timelines after assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold remediation affect my home's resale value?",
      answer: "Proper remediation with third-party clearance testing actually protects value. Undisclosed or improperly treated mold creates liability and negotiation leverage for buyers. Reston's competitive real estate market makes professional remediation with documentation essential for sellers."
