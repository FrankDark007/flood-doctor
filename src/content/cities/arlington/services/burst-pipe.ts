    headline: "When Pipes Burst in Arlington High-Rises, Every Floor Matters",
    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe on the 18th floor of a Rosslyn high-rise doesn't just affect one unit—it affects every floor below. Water cascades through ceiling cavities, electrical chases, and wall assemblies, reaching units that have no idea they're about to experience water damage. By the time the building shuts off the water supply, you might have twelve affected families, three insurance claims per floor, and an HOA board calling an emergency meeting.

Flood Doctor has responded to burst pipe emergencies throughout Arlington's high-rise landscape for nearly two decades. We've traced water from penthouse levels to parking garages in Crystal City towers, coordinated multi-unit extraction in Ballston condominiums, and dried the cascading damage from supply line failures in the Courthouse corridor. When Arlington building managers face pipe emergencies, they know to call us first.`,

      `Arlington's aging high-rise infrastructure creates burst pipe conditions that other markets don't experience. Buildings constructed in the 1970s and 1980s—which describes much of the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor—run original copper supply lines that are reaching end-of-life. Polybutylene piping, installed through the 1990s and now known to fail, exists in buildings throughout Pentagon City and Crystal City. Even newer construction uses PEX that can freeze in exterior walls during Arlington's coldest nights.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers understand high-rise plumbing architecture. We know that a burst supply line on one floor often indicates systemic issues the building should address. We trace water paths through construction that shares walls and floors. And we provide documentation that serves individual owners, HOA master policies, and building managers simultaneously.`
    ],
    localContext: "Arlington's high-rise density means burst pipes affect multiple parties—owners, neighbors, HOAs, and property managers. We've developed specialized protocols for multi-stakeholder events, ensuring everyone receives the documentation and communication they need while restoration proceeds without delay."

        title: "Aging High-Rise Supply Lines",
        description: "Much of Arlington's high-rise inventory dates from the 1970s-1990s. Original copper supply lines, some with pinhole corrosion, fail without warning. Polybutylene piping—now known to be defective—exists in thousands of units. These failures often occur overnight or while residents are traveling.",
        solution: "We respond 24/7 and coordinate with building management to access affected units—even when owners aren't home. Our documentation helps identify patterns that indicate building-wide plumbing issues, supporting HOA decisions on preventive replacement."
      },
      {
        title: "Cascading Multi-Unit Damage",
        description: "When a supply line bursts on a high floor, water follows gravity through floor assemblies, wall cavities, and electrical chases. A single pipe failure can affect a dozen units before anyone realizes water is flowing. Coordinating response across multiple affected families creates chaos.",
        solution: "We assign dedicated coordinators for multi-unit events. While extraction teams work each floor, our coordinator manages communication with all affected parties, building management, and insurance carriers. Everyone receives appropriate updates and documentation."
      },
      {
        title: "Frozen Pipe Failures in Exterior Walls",
        description: "Arlington's coldest nights—typically January through February—create freezing conditions in high-rise exterior walls. Units with supply lines running through these walls face freeze-burst risk, particularly corner units and those with north-facing plumbing. Modern PEX resists freezing better than copper but still fails under extreme cold.",
        solution: "We monitor weather patterns and position crews for rapid response during freeze events. For affected buildings, we document which units and pipe locations failed—information that helps HOA boards plan insulation improvements or pipe relocation."
      },
      {
        title: "Weekend and Holiday Failures",
        description: "Supply lines don't observe business hours. Many burst pipe calls come on weekends, holidays, or during overnight hours—when building management may be unavailable and owners may be traveling. Delayed response multiplies damage as water continues migrating.",
        solution: "Our 24/7 dispatch includes relationships with building management companies and after-hours contact protocols. We can often reach building engineers and gain access faster than the property owner can, minimizing the damage window."
      },
      {
        title: "Insurance Complexity with Multiple Policies",
        description: "A burst pipe affecting multiple units involves multiple HO-6 condo policies, possibly the source unit's liability coverage, and potentially the HOA's master policy. Sorting out coverage and coordinating claims becomes a full-time job.",
        solution: "We provide documentation tailored to each party's needs. Individual unit reports support personal claims. Building-wide documentation supports master policy review. Our coordinators work with adjusters from multiple carriers simultaneously."

  pricingSection: {
    headline: "Burst Pipe Repair & Cleanup Costs in Arlington",
    intro: "Arlington burst pipe restoration costs depend heavily on the number of affected units and the extent of water migration. A contained failure in a single unit costs far less than a cascading event affecting multiple floors. We provide free inspections and separate estimates for each affected unit while coordinating overall documentation.",
    factors: [
      "Number of affected units—cascading damage through multiple floors significantly increases restoration scope",
      "Building access and timing—after-hours response and freight elevator coordination add complexity",
      "Water migration extent—damage hidden in wall cavities and ceiling spaces requires more extensive drying",

      question: "What should I do immediately when a pipe bursts in my Arlington condo?",
      answer: "First, try to shut off water at your unit's valve if accessible—usually under sinks or behind toilets. If the main supply line burst, contact building management immediately for building-wide shutoff. Then call us at (703) 656-0102. Move valuables away from water and document damage with photos while waiting for response."
    },
    {
      question: "My neighbor's pipe burst and water is coming through my ceiling—what do I do?",
      answer: "Document the damage with photos immediately, then call us at (703) 656-0102 and notify building management. We'll assess both units and coordinate response. Your HO-6 condo policy typically covers damage to your unit regardless of the water's source—we provide documentation supporting your claim."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you access other units when the owners aren't home?",
      answer: "We coordinate with building management and property managers who typically have master key access for emergencies. For condos, HOA emergency provisions usually permit access for water events threatening other units or common areas. We document everything and communicate with absent owners as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do so many Arlington high-rises have burst pipe problems?",
      answer: "Age and original materials. Many buildings from the 1970s-1990s used copper supply lines now experiencing pinhole corrosion, or polybutylene piping now known to fail. Even newer buildings can have frozen pipe issues in exterior walls during extreme cold. We document failure patterns that help HOA boards plan preventive replacements."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my condo insurance cover burst pipe damage?",
      answer: "Typically yes—HO-6 condo policies cover sudden and accidental water damage from burst pipes, including damage to your interior finishes and personal property. Coverage for the pipe repair itself varies by policy. We provide documentation supporting your claim and coordinate with adjusters throughout the process."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does burst pipe restoration take in a high-rise?",
      answer: "Extraction typically completes within 4-8 hours depending on affected units. Drying takes 3-5 days with monitoring. Total restoration timeline depends on the extent of damage—simple ceiling repairs might take a week; extensive drywall replacement and floor restoration can take 2-4 weeks. We coordinate with contractors for efficient rebuilding."
