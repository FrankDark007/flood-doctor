    headline: "When Four Mile Run Rises and Storm Drains Back Up—Arlington's Flood Response Team",
    paragraphs: [
      `Arlington floods differently than suburban communities. When a summer storm dumps three inches in an hour, the county's dense development and impervious surfaces channel water toward the lowest points: Four Mile Run's flood plain, underground parking structures in Crystal City, basement apartments along Columbia Pike, and the storm drain systems throughout Rosslyn and Ballston that simply can't handle the volume.

Flood Doctor has responded to flood emergencies throughout Arlington for nearly two decades. We've pumped out the underground levels of Crystal City towers after flash floods, restored basement apartments in Fairlington after Four Mile Run overflowed, and dried commercial spaces in Clarendon after roof drains backed up during tropical storm remnants. When Arlington experiences its predictable—yet always surprising—flooding events, we're ready.`,

      `Flood cleanup in Arlington requires understanding the county's unique flood patterns. The Four Mile Run watershed, which crosses the county from Bluemont through Shirlington, creates flood risk for properties that aren't anywhere near visible water. Undersized storm drains in older neighborhoods back up into basements. Underground parking structures collect runoff from surrounding streets. And Arlington's aggressive development has increased impervious surface area faster than drainage infrastructure has improved.

Our IICRC-certified flood cleanup crews bring the equipment and expertise for Arlington's various flood scenarios: truck-mounted extraction for parking garages, portable systems for basement apartments, and contaminated water protocols for everything storm drains touch. We coordinate with building managers, HOAs, and individual property owners throughout the cleanup process.`
    ],
    localContext: "Arlington's development density—among the highest in Virginia—creates flood vulnerabilities that don't exist in suburban communities. From the Four Mile Run corridor to the underground levels of high-rise buildings, we've learned the county's flood patterns through decades of emergency response."

      {
        title: "Four Mile Run Watershed Flooding",
        description: "Four Mile Run—which flows from Bluemont through Shirlington—floods during major storms, affecting properties throughout its watershed. But the flood risk extends beyond visible water: undersized storm drains connected to the watershed back up into basements and parking structures well before the creek actually overflows.",
        solution: "We respond to Four Mile Run corridor flooding with contaminated water protocols, recognizing that storm drain backup introduces bacteria and pollutants. Our crews know which Arlington neighborhoods face watershed flood risk and arrive prepared for Category 2 or 3 cleanup."
      },
      {
        title: "Underground Parking Structure Flooding",
        description: "Crystal City, Pentagon City, and Rosslyn towers funnel runoff into parking garage drains during heavy storms. When storm systems exceed capacity, water pools in underground levels—threatening hundreds of vehicles and building infrastructure including elevator machinery, electrical rooms, and storage areas.",
        solution: "We deploy truck-mounted extraction systems capable of removing tens of thousands of gallons. Our crews coordinate with building engineers on infrastructure protection, utility isolation, and vehicle access while continuously pumping until parking levels are clear."
      },
      {
        title: "Basement Apartment Flooding",
        description: "Arlington's housing demand has pushed many homeowners to finish basement apartments—common in Fairlington, Shirlington, and along Columbia Pike. These below-grade spaces flood during major storms, destroying flooring, drywall, and tenant belongings while creating habitability emergencies.",
        solution: "We treat flooded basement apartments with the urgency of any occupied living space. Rapid extraction, immediate content documentation, and aggressive drying minimize total damage while providing documentation for both owner and tenant insurance claims."

      {
        title: "Flash Flood Timing and Access",
        description: "Arlington floods during business hours, overnight, on weekends, and holidays—whenever the rain falls. Flash flooding can occur during rush hour, making response complicated by gridlocked traffic on Route 50, I-66, and Wilson Boulevard.",
        solution: "We maintain crews throughout Arlington during storm events and know alternative routes when main arteries flood or gridlock. Our dispatchers monitor traffic conditions and route trucks around congestion. We arrive, even when the roads don't cooperate."

    headline: "Flood Cleanup Costs in Arlington",
    intro: "Arlington flood cleanup costs depend on the affected space size, water contamination level, and extent of material removal required. Storm drain backup and exterior flooding typically classify as Category 2 or 3 (contaminated), requiring more extensive cleanup than clean water events. We provide free inspections and detailed estimates before work begins.",
    factors: [
      "Space size and type—parking garages require different equipment and hours than basement apartments",
      "Water category—contaminated flood water requires antimicrobial treatment and extensive material removal",
      "Depth and duration—deeper water and longer standing time mean more damaged materials",
      "Building type—high-rise coordination adds complexity compared to single-family flood cleanup",
      "Contents affected—commercial inventory or personal property requires documentation and possible restoration"

    {
      question: "Is flood water from storms contaminated?",
      answer: "Almost always. Storm drain backup, street runoff, and Four Mile Run overflow all introduce bacteria, chemicals, and pollutants. We classify most storm flooding as Category 2 (gray water) or Category 3 (black water), requiring antimicrobial treatment and removal of contaminated porous materials. This protects your health and prevents long-term problems."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can you respond during major storms?",
      answer: "We pre-position crews throughout Arlington when significant storms approach. During active flooding, response times depend on storm severity and the number of simultaneous emergencies—but we deploy continuously until every call is addressed. During major events, we may work 24-48 hours straight responding to Arlington properties."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you pump out a flooded parking garage during the storm?",
      answer: "Yes, though extraction competes with incoming water during active rainfall. We begin immediately even if water is still entering—removing water faster than it enters prevents levels from rising further. Once rain stops, extraction accelerates. We coordinate with building management throughout and protect infrastructure while pumping."
    },
    {
      question: "My basement apartment flooded—is it safe to enter?",
      answer: "Not until we assess electrical hazards and water contamination. Storm flooding often energizes outlets and appliances while introducing bacteria from storm drains. Call us at (703) 656-0102 before entering. We'll verify safety, begin extraction, and work to make the space habitable again as quickly as possible."
    },
    {
      question: "Does homeowner's insurance cover flood damage?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's policies typically don't cover exterior flood damage—you need separate flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program. However, if water entered through a failed sump pump or interior drain backup, your homeowner's policy may provide coverage. We document the water source to support your claim regardless of which policy applies."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take?",
      answer: "Extraction typically completes within 4-12 hours depending on space size. Material removal adds another day. Drying takes 5-7 days with industrial equipment running continuously. Total timeline from flooding to ready-for-rebuild typically runs 7-10 days. We work aggressively to minimize the time your property is unusable."
