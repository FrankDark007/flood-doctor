  introSection: {
    paragraph: `In Arlington's high-density environment, water emergencies escalate fast. A burst pipe on the 20th floor of a Rosslyn tower reaches the 15th floor in minutes. A failed washing machine hose in a Clarendon condo floods your downstairs neighbor's ceiling before you realize there's a problem. Underground parking in Crystal City can fill with inches of water during heavy storms.

Flood Doctor provides 30-minute emergency water removal throughout Arlington County. Our crews understand that urban density changes the emergency equation—we don't just extract water from your space, we contain damage before it spreads to others.

Our truck-mounted extraction systems remove thousands of gallons per hour. Our building coordination protocols ensure HOAs, property managers, and affected neighbors are notified appropriately. Our multi-unit drying capability addresses the reality that water in Arlington rarely stays in one place.`,

    urgencyNote: "EVERY MINUTE MATTERS: Water travels through building structures at approximately 1 floor every 15-20 minutes. In Arlington's high-rises, delayed response means exponentially more units affected. Call immediately."
  },

  localContext: {
    headline: "Emergency Water Response for Arlington's Urban Reality",
    content: `Arlington's building density requires different emergency protocols than suburban areas:

**Multi-unit cascade prevention.** When water enters a high-rise unit, our first priority is containing spread to other units. This means rapid extraction combined with communication to building management about shutting water sources and alerting potentially affected neighbors.

**Building system protection.** Water threatening elevators, electrical systems, or building HVAC requires immediate coordination with building engineers. We know which systems are critical and work with building staff to protect infrastructure.

**HOA and property management coordination.** Most Arlington buildings require specific notification and documentation procedures. We handle this coordination while extraction is underway—you don't have to choose between calling management and getting water out.

**Access challenges.** Freight elevators, service entrances, parking garage staging—getting extraction equipment into Arlington buildings requires local knowledge. Our crews know the access protocols for major buildings throughout the county.

**After-hours response.** Water emergencies don't wait for business hours. We coordinate with building security for after-hours access and have relationships with property management companies throughout Arlington for rapid authorization.`,

      question: "How fast can you actually get to my Arlington high-rise?",
      answer: "We guarantee 30-minute response to all Arlington addresses. Our crews are positioned throughout Northern Virginia, not at a single distant warehouse. For Rosslyn, Crystal City, Ballston, and Clarendon—we're typically there faster."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do while waiting for you to arrive?",
      answer: "If safe: turn off the water source if you know where it is, move valuables above the water line, open interior doors to slow spread, and take photos for documentation. Don't enter water if there's any electrical hazard. We'll guide you through specific steps when you call."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you coordinate with my building management?",
      answer: "Yes. We notify property management, coordinate building access, communicate with affected neighbors when appropriate, and provide documentation that satisfies HOA requirements. You don't have to manage multiple parties during an emergency."
    },
    {
      question: "What if water is affecting my neighbors' units?",
      answer: "We assess multi-unit impact as part of every Arlington high-rise response. If water has spread, we recommend notifying building management and can deploy to multiple units simultaneously. Our documentation supports all affected parties' insurance claims."
    },
    {

      answer: "24/7/365. Water emergencies don't wait for business hours. We coordinate with building security for access, have relationships with major Arlington property management companies for rapid authorization, and respond just as fast at 3 AM as at 3 PM."
