    headline: "When Storms Hit Arlington's Towers and Townhomes—We Respond",
    paragraphs: [
      `Storms affect Arlington differently than surrounding suburbs. When high winds sweep through Rosslyn's tower canyons, they accelerate between buildings and rip through rooftop equipment. When summer downpours overwhelm storm drains, underground parking structures in Crystal City fill faster than pumps can evacuate. When tropical storm remnants stall overhead, flat-roofed mid-century buildings throughout Bluemont and Ashton Heights develop ponding that eventually finds its way inside.

Flood Doctor has responded to storm damage throughout Arlington for nearly two decades. We've tarped damaged roofs on Clarendon commercial buildings, pumped out flooded parking garages in Pentagon City, and dried water-damaged units in Ballston condominiums after wind-driven rain breached building envelopes. When storms hit Arlington's diverse building stock, we respond with the right equipment for each situation.`,

      `Arlington's storm vulnerabilities reflect its unique building landscape. High-rise towers with rooftop HVAC equipment face wind damage that ground-level buildings don't experience. Mid-century flat-roof construction—common in the county's residential neighborhoods—accumulates water that pitched roofs would shed. Underground parking structures collect runoff from surrounding streets when storm drains back up. And the county's mature tree canopy, while beautiful, sends limbs through windows and onto roofs during severe weather.

Our IICRC-certified storm damage crews understand that Arlington storm response often means multiple simultaneous challenges: tarping the roof breach while extracting water from affected interior spaces, or pumping a parking garage while checking whether vehicles need relocation. We coordinate with property managers, HOAs, and individual owners throughout these multi-faceted emergencies.`
    ],
    localContext: "Arlington's mix of high-rises, mid-century flat-roof buildings, and mature tree coverage creates storm damage patterns unique to the county. We've learned these patterns through decades of emergency response—from Rosslyn rooftops to Shirlington street-level retail."

      {
        title: "High-Rise Wind Damage",
        description: "Arlington's Rosslyn, Crystal City, and Ballston towers create wind tunnel effects during severe storms. Wind accelerates between buildings, damaging rooftop HVAC equipment, ripping membrane roofing, and driving rain through window systems designed for lower wind loads. Upper floors experience damage that lower floors don't see.",
        solution: "We have crews trained for high-rise rooftop access and emergency tarping. For wind-driven rain intrusion, we trace water paths through the building envelope and extract from all affected floors. Documentation captures the wind damage patterns that roofing contractors need for permanent repair."
      },
      {
        title: "Flat Roof Ponding and Leakage",
        description: "Mid-century flat-roof construction—common throughout Arlington's residential neighborhoods—handles heavy rain poorly. Drains clog with debris, water ponds, and eventually finds pathways inside through membrane failures, seam separations, or penetration flashings. By the time water appears inside, significant ponding has already occurred.",
        solution: "We clear clogged roof drains when accessible and set up temporary pumping to reduce ponding. Inside, we extract water and dry affected areas. Our documentation of roof conditions helps owners understand the maintenance or replacement decisions ahead."
      },
      {
        title: "Underground Parking Flooding",
        description: "Crystal City and Pentagon City parking structures collect runoff from surrounding streets during heavy storms. When storm drain capacity is exceeded, water flows into garage ramps and accumulates in lower levels—threatening vehicles, elevator machinery, electrical rooms, and storage areas.",
        solution: "We deploy truck-mounted extraction systems capable of removing tens of thousands of gallons. Our crews coordinate with building engineers on infrastructure protection, utility isolation, and vehicle relocation while continuously pumping until parking levels are clear."
      },
      {
        title: "Tree Damage to Roofs and Windows",
        description: "Arlington's mature tree canopy—beautiful in calm weather—becomes a hazard during high winds. Falling limbs puncture roofs, shatter windows, and damage building facades throughout the county's residential neighborhoods. Storm damage from trees creates immediate building envelope breaches.",
        solution: "We provide emergency tarping and boarding to secure building envelope breaches while tree services remove fallen debris. Once the structure is secured, we extract any water that entered and dry affected interior spaces. Documentation captures both exterior and interior damage for insurance claims."

      {
        title: "Multi-Building Commercial Storm Response",
        description: "Arlington's commercial property managers often oversee multiple buildings across the county. When storms damage multiple properties simultaneously, coordinating response becomes overwhelming. Properties compete for attention while damage spreads.",
        solution: "We assign coordinators for property management companies with multiple affected buildings. Priority triaging ensures the most urgent situations receive immediate response while all properties receive attention according to severity. One point of contact manages the entire portfolio response."

High-rise access requirements add complexity. We provide free assessments and detailed estimates before work begins, documenting everything for insurance claims.",
    factors: [
      "Damage type—roof breaches, window failures, and flooding each require different restoration approaches",
      "Water intrusion extent—more affected areas mean more extraction and drying equipment",
      "Building access—high-rise rooftop work and freight elevator coordination add complexity",

      question: "Should I call during the storm or wait until it passes?",
      answer: "Call as soon as you have damage, even during the storm. We begin responding while weather is still active and prioritize calls by severity. The sooner you call, the sooner we can dispatch—and every hour of delay allows water damage to worsen. We'll reach you as quickly as conditions safely permit."

    {
      question: "My high-rise condo has wind-driven rain coming through the windows—what do I do?",
      answer: "Move belongings away from affected windows, put down towels to limit water spread, and call us at (703) 656-0102. Wind-driven rain through window systems indicates either window failure or sealant deterioration. We'll extract water, dry affected areas, and document the intrusion pattern for insurance and building management."
    },
    {
      question: "The parking garage under my building is flooding—who do I call?",
      answer: "Contact building management immediately, then call us at (703) 656-0102. We'll coordinate with building staff on access, utility protection, and vehicle relocation while deploying extraction equipment. Garage flooding threatens building infrastructure—elevators, electrical rooms, mechanical systems—and requires rapid response."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover storm damage?",
      answer: "Most homeowner's and commercial property policies cover wind and storm damage, including water damage that results from roof or window breaches. Flood damage from rising water may require separate flood insurance. We document the damage source—wind, rain intrusion, or flooding—to support your claim under the applicable policy."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent mold after storm water damage?",
      answer: "Complete drying within 24-48 hours prevents most mold growth. We deploy industrial dehumidifiers and air movers immediately after extraction and monitor moisture levels until they return to normal—typically 3-7 days depending on damage extent. Rushing the drying process invites mold problems later."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help if multiple of our properties were damaged by the storm?",
      answer: "Yes. We assign coordinators for property managers with multiple affected buildings. We prioritize by severity—immediate safety hazards first, then water damage that will worsen if left unaddressed, then less urgent repairs. One contact manages your entire portfolio response, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks."
