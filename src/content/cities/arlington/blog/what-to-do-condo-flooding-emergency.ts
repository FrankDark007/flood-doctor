    introduction: `You've discovered water flooding your Arlington condo—from a burst pipe, failed appliance, upstairs neighbor's unit, or building system failure. In high-density buildings, the next few minutes determine whether this becomes a manageable incident or a building-wide crisis.

This guide provides the specific steps for Arlington condo emergencies, where multi-unit coordination and building system awareness change the equation.`,

        heading: "First 2 Minutes: Safety and Containment",
        content: `**Assess electrical safety immediately.**
Water near outlets, appliances, or electrical panels creates shock hazards. If water is anywhere near electrical systems:
- Do not enter the water
- If you can safely reach your breaker panel, turn off power to affected areas
- If the panel is in or near water, stay away and call your utility or building management

**Identify and stop the water source if possible.**
- Supply line failure: Turn off the valve at the fixture (under sink, behind toilet, at washing machine)
- If you can't stop it at the fixture: Locate and turn off your unit's main water shutoff
- If water is coming from above: You can't stop it from your unit—building management needs to access the source unit

**Alert anyone in immediate danger.**
If water is cascading from your ceiling to your floor to potentially your neighbor below, a quick knock on their door can save them from returning to a flooded unit.`

        heading: "Minutes 2-5: Building Management Contact",
        content: `**Call building management or emergency line immediately.**

Every Arlington high-rise has emergency contact procedures:
- Daytime: Front desk, management office, or maintenance staff
- After hours: Emergency phone line, security desk, or posted emergency number

**What to communicate:**
1. Your unit number and location
2. What's happening (water flooding, where it's coming from)
3. Whether you've been able to stop the source
4. Whether water appears to be affecting other areas
5. Any safety concerns (electrical, ceiling sagging, etc.)

**Building management can:**
- Access the source unit if water is coming from above
- Shut off water to affected areas
- Alert building engineers about threatened systems
- Notify other potentially affected residents
- Coordinate emergency access for restoration companies

Don't wait for callbacks or assume someone else is handling it. Building management needs to know immediately.`
      },
      {
        heading: "Minutes 5-15: Call for Professional Help",
        content: `**Call Flood Doctor: (703) 656-0102**

Do this while building management is working on building-level response. We can:
- Coordinate with your building's protocols
- Begin extraction as soon as access is arranged
- Deploy to multiple affected units if needed
- Provide the multi-unit coordination high-rises require

**While waiting for help to arrive:**

*If safe to do so:*
- Move furniture and valuables away from water
- Elevate items onto beds, tables, or shelves
- Pull area rugs off hardwood floors
- Remove items from lower shelves and cabinets
- Place towels along doorways to slow spread

*Document everything:*
- Photograph and video water sources, spread, and damage
- Document water levels and affected areas
- Capture any visible cause (failed hose, appliance, etc.)
- Note the time you discovered the water

*Do not:*
- Use household vacuums on water (electrocution risk)
- Enter standing water if there's any electrical concern
- Try to dry large areas yourself
- Wait to see if it stops on its own`

        heading: "If Water Is Coming From Above",
        content: `When your neighbor's water problem becomes your emergency:

**You cannot stop it yourself.** The source is in another unit you don't have access to. Building management must either contact the neighbor or authorize emergency access to stop the flow.

**What you can do:**
- Call building management immediately—they have emergency access authority
- Ask security or front desk to attempt contact with the unit above
- If you know the neighbor, try calling or texting directly
- Document the water entry point with photos

**Protect your unit while waiting:**
- Move belongings away from the water entry area
- Place buckets or containers to catch falling water
- Put plastic sheeting over furniture that can't be moved
- Keep doors open to slow water spread into confined areas

**The source unit owner may not be home.** This is common. Building management can authorize emergency entry to stop active flooding. Delays in reaching the owner are why water cascade events become so damaging—every minute matters.`

      {
        heading: "If Your Water Is Affecting Neighbors Below",
        content: `When your emergency becomes your neighbor's problem:

**Your immediate priorities:**
1. Stop the water source (turn off supply valves or unit main)
2. Alert building management so they can notify affected units
3. Call Flood Doctor: (703) 656-0102
4. If safe and you know your downstairs neighbor, give them a heads-up directly

**Understand your potential liability:**
Water originating in your unit may make you liable for damage to units below. Your HO-6 policy's liability coverage protects you, but:
- Document the cause thoroughly
- Preserve the failed component if possible (failed hose, etc.)
- Cooperate fully with building management's documentation
- File a claim with your insurer promptly

**Don't minimize to your neighbors.**
Honest communication preserves relationships. They'll discover the full extent soon enough—being upfront about what happened and what you're doing about it builds goodwill during a difficult situation.`

        heading: "Hours 1-24: Professional Response and Next Steps",
        content: `**When Flood Doctor arrives:**

*Assessment:*
- We evaluate the full extent of water spread—often more than visible
- Moisture meters identify water in walls, floors, and ceilings
- We assess multi-unit implications and coordinate with building management

*Extraction:*
- Industrial extraction removes standing water rapidly
- For multi-floor events, we deploy to all affected units simultaneously
- Building system protection is coordinated with facilities staff

*Drying setup:*
- Air movers and dehumidifiers begin the drying process
- Equipment placement considers both your unit and impact on neighbors
- We monitor moisture levels throughout the drying period

**Insurance coordination:**
- Contact your insurance carrier within 24 hours
- We provide documentation supporting your claim
- For multi-unit events, our documentation helps sort out coverage among affected parties

**Realistic timeline:**
- Emergency extraction: Same day
- Active drying: 3-5 days typically
- Reaching target moisture levels: 5-7 days
- Restoration/reconstruction: Varies based on damage

You may need alternative accommodations during active drying. Document any additional living expenses for insurance.`

        heading: "Building-Wide Emergencies",
        content: `Sometimes condo flooding isn't one unit—it's a building event:

**Recognize building-level emergencies:**
- Multiple units reporting water simultaneously
- Water in hallways or common areas
- Elevator out of service due to water
- Building fire alarm activated by water (some sprinkler events)
- Parking garage flooding

**Your role in building emergencies:**
- Follow building evacuation procedures if activated
- Report conditions in your unit to building management
- Don't try to investigate other areas—let building staff coordinate
- Provide access when building management requests
- Keep your phone available for building communications

**Flood Doctor's role in building events:**
We coordinate with building management on building-wide response:
- Deploy multiple crews to affected areas simultaneously
- Prioritize building infrastructure protection
- Provide documentation supporting master policy claims
- Communicate with individual unit owners as appropriate

Building-level coordination requires experience with high-rise emergency protocols—we've managed these events throughout Arlington's corridors.`
