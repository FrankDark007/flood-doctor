    introduction: `Water damage in Arlington condos creates insurance questions that single-family homeowners never face. When water floods from one unit to another, who pays? When building plumbing fails and damages multiple units, does the HOA's master policy cover everything? When damage crosses property lines, how do multiple claims interact?

After nearly two decades of handling Arlington condo water damage, Flood Doctor has navigated these questions hundreds of times. This guide explains the typical frameworks, though your specific condo documents and policies govern your situation.`,

        heading: "Understanding the Two-Policy System",
        content: `Arlington condos are protected by two distinct insurance policies:

**The Master Policy (HOA's insurance):**
This building-wide policy covers common areas (hallways, lobbies, amenities) and some portion of individual units. Coverage for unit interiors varies significantly:

- **"Studs-out" or "bare walls" coverage:** The master policy covers the building structure but not unit interiors. Unit owners must insure everything inside the walls—flooring, fixtures, cabinets, appliances.
- **"Studs-in" or "all-in" coverage:** The master policy covers building structure plus original unit improvements—original flooring, fixtures, etc. Unit owners insure only personal property and upgrades.

**Your HO-6 Policy (unit owner's insurance):**
This policy covers what the master policy doesn't:
- Personal property (furniture, clothing, electronics)
- Interior improvements and upgrades you've made
- Loss assessment coverage (your share of deductibles or uninsured building claims)
- Liability coverage (damage you cause to others)

**Critical first step:** Read your condo documents and master policy summary to understand exactly where building coverage ends and your responsibility begins.`

        heading: "Water Damage Scenario: Leak From Above",
        content: `The most common Arlington condo water scenario: water from an upstairs unit damages your ceiling, walls, and property.

**How responsibility typically divides:**

*The source unit owner is typically responsible for:*
- Repairing the source of the leak (their supply line, appliance, etc.)
- Damage to their own unit
- Potentially liable for damage caused to your unit, depending on cause

*Your HO-6 policy typically covers:*
- Your personal property (regardless of who caused the damage)
- Interior damage to your unit (flooring, drywall, etc.) that's within your coverage responsibility
- Additional living expenses if you're displaced

*What often happens:*
Your HO-6 policy pays for your damage, then your insurer may pursue the upstairs neighbor's liability coverage to recover costs (subrogation). You shouldn't have to wait for fault determination to get your damage addressed.

**Documentation matters:** Photos, videos, and professional damage reports help establish where water originated and what it damaged—essential for proper claim allocation.`
      },
      {
        heading: "Water Damage Scenario: Building System Failure",
        content: `When building plumbing, HVAC, or other systems cause water damage to multiple units:

**Master policy coverage typically applies when:**
- Common area plumbing fails (main supply lines, drain stacks, shared infrastructure)
- Building HVAC systems cause water damage
- Roof or building envelope failures allow water entry
- Fire suppression systems activate

**Complexity factors:**

*Large deductibles:* Master policies often have $10,000-$50,000+ deductibles. Affected unit owners may be assessed their share of the deductible even though they didn't cause the problem.

*Coverage gaps:* Master policies may cover the building but not unit contents or improvements. You may need to file HO-6 claims for personal property and interior damage even when the master policy covers structural repair.

*Multi-unit coordination:* When one event affects many units, the building's master policy claim and multiple unit owner claims must be coordinated. Documentation and communication become critical.

**Loss assessment coverage:** This HO-6 endorsement helps pay your share of building deductibles or uninsured claims. In Arlington's high-rises, this coverage is essential—even small per-unit assessments on 200-unit buildings create significant total claims.`
      },
      {
        heading: "Your Responsibility When You Cause Damage",
        content: `When water originating in your unit damages neighbors below:

**Liability coverage is your protection:**
Your HO-6 policy includes liability coverage—typically $100,000-$300,000. This covers damage you cause to other units, including:
- Water damage to units below you
- Personal property damage in affected units
- Additional living expenses for displaced neighbors

**When liability limits matter:**
In Arlington high-rises, cascade events can affect multiple units. If your supply line failure damages 5 units below you, $100,000 in liability coverage may be insufficient. Consider increasing limits to $300,000-$500,000 for high-rise condos.

**Your condo association may also pursue you:**
Building documents often hold unit owners responsible for damage caused by their negligence. The HOA might pursue you for master policy deductibles or repair costs beyond insurance coverage.

**Maintaining your unit matters legally:**
If your water damage resulted from failure to maintain your unit (ignoring a known leak, failing to replace aging supply lines), your liability exposure increases. Courts and insurers distinguish between true accidents and preventable failures.`

        heading: "Working with Your HOA During Water Emergencies",
        content: `Arlington condo water emergencies require HOA coordination:

**Immediate steps:**
1. Report the emergency to building management immediately
2. Call Flood Doctor: (703) 656-0102
3. Request emergency access to source unit if water is coming from above
4. Document everything with photos and notes
5. Notify your insurance carrier within 24 hours

**HOA's role during emergencies:**
- Providing emergency access to units (including breaking locks if necessary to stop flooding)
- Contacting affected unit owners
- Coordinating with building systems personnel on shutoffs
- Documenting the event for master policy claims
- Communicating with all affected parties

**Your role:**
- Mitigating damage to your unit (moving belongings, using towels, etc.)
- Providing access for inspection and restoration
- Filing your HO-6 claim promptly
- Documenting your personal property damage
- Keeping receipts for any emergency expenses

**Common friction points:**
- Delays in accessing source units can allow damage to spread
- HOA may want to use their preferred vendors; you have rights too
- Deductible assessments can create disputes about responsibility
- Communication breakdowns leave owners confused about claim status

Professional restoration companies experienced with Arlington condos can help navigate these coordination challenges.`

        heading: "Documentation for Multi-Party Claims",
        content: `Proper documentation supports claims under multiple policies:

**Photograph and video:**
- Water source location (if visible)
- Water spread and affected areas
- Damage to building elements (ceiling, walls, flooring)
- Damage to personal property
- Any visible cause (failed hose, appliance, etc.)

**Written records:**
- Date and time water discovered
- Who you notified and when
- Building management's response
- Any emergency steps you took
- Communications with neighbors, HOA, insurance

**Professional documentation:**
Flood Doctor provides comprehensive documentation as part of every Arlington condo restoration:
- Moisture readings throughout affected areas
- Photos of water source, spread, and damage
- Detailed scope of work for repair
- Equipment deployment logs
- Progress photos throughout restoration

This documentation supports claims under:
- Your HO-6 policy for personal property and interior damage
- The building's master policy for structural damage
- Liability claims against the source unit owner
- Loss assessment claims for your share of building deductibles`

        heading: "Choosing Between Restoration Options",
        content: `Arlington condo water damage often presents options for how restoration proceeds:

**HOA-directed restoration:**
Some HOA master policies require using specific vendors for building-related restoration. This ensures consistent quality across the building and may streamline master policy claims.

*Advantages:* Coordination with building systems, master policy alignment, HOA handles logistics
*Considerations:* May not address your personal property, timing may prioritize building over units

**Unit owner-directed restoration:**
You may have the right to choose your own restoration company for damage within your unit, particularly for personal property and interior damage covered by your HO-6.

*Advantages:* Direct communication and control, can address your specific concerns, choose company you trust
*Considerations:* Must coordinate with HOA for building access and system issues

**Coordinated approach:**
Often the best outcome combines building-level response (master policy work) with unit-level restoration (your HO-6 coverage). Flood Doctor works with both HOAs and individual owners, coordinating our response with whatever building-level work is occurring.

Regardless of approach, prompt response matters. Don't wait for insurance or HOA authorization to begin emergency mitigation—every hour of delay increases damage and cost for all parties.`

    ],
