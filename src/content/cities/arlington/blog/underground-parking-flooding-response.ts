    introduction: `Arlington's underground parking garages serve thousands of vehicles and house critical building infrastructure—elevators, electrical systems, storage areas, and mechanical equipment. When heavy storms overwhelm drainage capacity, these below-grade spaces fill with water faster than most building managers expect.

Flood Doctor has responded to parking garage flooding throughout Arlington's high-density corridors for nearly two decades. This guide shares what we've learned about protecting vehicles, infrastructure, and building operations when water enters underground parking.`,

        heading: "Why Arlington Parking Garages Flood",
        content: `Underground parking flooding in Arlington typically results from:

**Storm drain overwhelm.** During heavy rain, Arlington's storm drainage system can exceed capacity. Water that can't drain flows downhill—and into garage ramps that slope below grade. Rosslyn's hillside garages and Crystal City's extensive underground network are particularly vulnerable.

**Garage drainage failure.** Internal garage drains handle normal vehicle drip, wash water, and minor infiltration. They're not designed for storm water volumes. When drain capacity is exceeded, water accumulates.

**Sump pump failure.** Many garages rely on sump pumps to remove water. Pump failures during storms—from age, power loss, or overwhelming volume—allow rapid accumulation.

**Building infiltration.** Cracks in garage walls and floors allow groundwater entry during saturated soil conditions. This happens even without surface flooding.

**Elevator shaft flooding.** Elevator pits at garage level collect water from multiple sources. When pits fill, water damages elevator equipment and threatens building vertical transportation.

Understanding your building's specific vulnerabilities helps prioritize prevention and response planning.`

        heading: "The First 30 Minutes: Critical Response",
        content: `When water enters your parking garage, immediate actions determine outcomes:

**Immediately:**
1. **Assess electrical hazards.** Water near electrical panels, elevator equipment, or charging stations creates shock hazards. If water is near electrical systems, keep people out and call your electrician.

2. **Alert building engineers.** Your facilities team needs to isolate threatened systems—elevator pits, electrical rooms, mechanical equipment.

3. **Call Flood Doctor: (703) 656-0102.** Industrial extraction capacity determines how quickly water is removed. Start the response clock immediately.

4. **Begin vehicle notification.** If time and staffing permit, start alerting vehicle owners in the most affected areas. Even brief warning allows some vehicle relocation.

5. **Photograph current conditions.** Documentation starts now—water levels, affected areas, visible infrastructure exposure.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't enter standing water if there's any electrical hazard
- Don't wait to see if it drains on its own—garage drains can't handle storm volumes
- Don't delay calling for professional extraction—every inch of depth adds hundreds of gallons`

        heading: "Protecting Critical Infrastructure",
        content: `Underground parking houses building systems that require immediate protection:

**Elevator equipment:**
Elevator pits sit at the lowest garage level. Rising water reaches elevator equipment first—hydraulic systems, motors, and controls that cost tens of thousands to replace.

*Protection priority:* Alert your elevator service immediately. They may be able to park cars at upper floors and isolate systems before damage occurs.

**Electrical systems:**
Many garages have electrical panels, switchgear, or transformer rooms at parking level. Water contact can damage equipment and create building-wide power issues.

*Protection priority:* Have your electrician isolate threatened panels if this can be done safely. Document any equipment water contact for insurance.

**Mechanical equipment:**
Pumps, compressors, and HVAC equipment at parking level face damage from flooding. Some equipment can be temporarily elevated; others require system isolation.

*Protection priority:* Work with facilities staff to identify threatened equipment and isolate systems before water contact.

**Storage areas:**
Many garages include resident storage units. Contents may be difficult to protect once flooding begins, but documentation supports insurance claims.

*Protection priority:* Document storage area flooding for building insurance and resident notification.`

        heading: "Vehicle Owner Communication",
        content: `Vehicles in flooded garages face increasing damage with water depth and duration:

**Damage thresholds:**
- 4-6 inches: Floor carpets wet, potential electrical issues
- 12+ inches: Seat upholstery, door panels, electronics affected
- 18+ inches: Engine intake potential (depending on vehicle), dashboard electronics
- 24+ inches: Most vehicles considered total losses

**Communication priorities:**
1. Alert owners in the most affected areas first
2. Provide honest assessment of current conditions
3. Give specific instructions on whether moving vehicles is safe
4. Document which owners were contacted and when

**When vehicle relocation isn't safe:**
If water is above tire height or electrical hazards exist, attempting to drive out risks both people and vehicles. Professional extraction to reduce water levels may be necessary before any vehicle movement.

**After flooding:**
Document all vehicles with water contact. Building management and individual vehicle owners will need this for insurance claims. Professional assessment of flood-damaged vehicles determines salvageability.`

        heading: "Professional Extraction Process",
        content: `Flood Doctor's parking garage response includes:

**Equipment deployment:**
We deploy truck-mounted extraction systems capable of removing hundreds of gallons per minute. For large Crystal City or Pentagon City garages, we may deploy multiple systems simultaneously.

**Water removal sequence:**
1. Extract standing water from the lowest points first
2. Remove water from areas around critical infrastructure
3. Clear driving lanes to allow vehicle relocation
4. Extract remaining water from perimeter areas
5. Address water in elevator pits and sumps

**Infrastructure assessment:**
During and after extraction, we assess:
- Elevator pit conditions
- Electrical system water exposure
- Mechanical equipment status
- Structural concerns (significant debris, damage)

**Cleanup and drying:**
After bulk water removal:
- Surface cleaning of garage floors
- Drying equipment deployment if needed
- Debris removal
- Drain system assessment

**Documentation:**
Comprehensive documentation supports building insurance claims, including:
- Before/during/after photos
- Water volume estimates
- Infrastructure exposure assessment
- Timeline of response and extraction`

        heading: "Insurance and Financial Considerations",
        content: `Parking garage flooding creates multiple insurance claim streams:

**Building master policy:**
Typically covers:
- Infrastructure damage (elevators, electrical, mechanical)
- Garage structural cleaning and repair
- Common area damage

Does NOT typically cover:
- Individual vehicle damage
- Personal property in storage units

**Vehicle owner insurance:**
Each affected vehicle owner files under their own auto insurance (comprehensive coverage). Building management facilitates but doesn't handle individual vehicle claims.

**Resident property insurance:**
Contents of flooded storage units are typically covered under residents' HO-6 policies, not building master policies.

**Building documentation responsibilities:**
- Photograph all infrastructure affected
- Document water levels and duration
- Record all affected vehicles with owner information
- Maintain communication logs
- Preserve all extraction and repair invoices

**Common complications:**
- Distinguishing pre-existing damage from flood damage
- Determining vehicle value for totaled vehicles
- Coordination between multiple insurance carriers
- Deductible responsibilities in mixed-responsibility situations`

        heading: "Prevention and Preparedness",
        content: `Reduce garage flooding risk with proactive measures:

**Drainage maintenance:**
- Clean garage floor drains quarterly
- Inspect and test sump pumps monthly
- Clear debris from ramp drains before storm season
- Consider installing larger-capacity pumps for flood-prone buildings

**Infrastructure protection:**
- Ensure elevator pit sump pumps function properly
- Verify electrical panels are elevated where possible
- Install water sensors in elevator pits and low areas
- Consider flood barriers for ramp entrances in vulnerable buildings

**Response planning:**
- Develop written emergency response procedures
- Identify which staff have authority for emergency decisions after hours
- Maintain current vehicle registration and owner contact information
- Establish relationships with extraction contractors before emergencies
- Know your building's electrical isolation procedures

**Communication systems:**
- Test mass notification systems regularly
- Maintain current resident contact information
- Have templates ready for emergency communications
- Establish who communicates during emergencies

Buildings that plan ahead recover faster. A 3 AM flooding emergency is not the time to figure out response protocols.`
