    headline: "Fairfax Fire & Smoke Damage Restoration",
    paragraphs: [
      `After the fire trucks leave your Burke home, the reality sets in. Your kitchen is charred. Smoke has infiltrated every room. Water from firefighting has soaked through floors and into the basement. The house you've lived in for fifteen years feels foreign—damaged, sooty, and overwhelming. Where do you even begin?

Flood Doctor has helped Fairfax families recover from fire damage for nearly two decades. We've restored smoke-damaged colonials in Kings Park, cleaned soot from every surface in Mantua split-levels, and extracted thousands of gallons of firefighting water from Burke basements. Fire damage is devastating, but it's not the end. With professional restoration, many fire-damaged homes return to their pre-loss condition—and we help families through every step of that process.`,

      `Fire damage is more than burned materials. Smoke permeates soft surfaces, ductwork, and wall cavities throughout the home—often far beyond the fire's origin. Soot contains corrosive compounds that continue damaging surfaces for days after the fire. And the water used to fight the fire creates its own damage—saturating floors, walls, and ceilings, creating mold risk if not properly dried.

Our IICRC-certified fire damage technicians understand this complexity. We address smoke odor with specialized equipment, not just masking agents. We clean soot before it causes permanent damage to surfaces. We extract firefighting water and dry the structure properly. And we coordinate the complete restoration process—from initial board-up through final reconstruction—so Fairfax families have one team managing their recovery.`

    localContext: "Fairfax homes face fire risks common to all communities—kitchen fires, electrical issues, heating equipment failures. When fire strikes, professional restoration addresses not just visible damage but smoke infiltration, soot contamination, and water damage from firefighting."

    challenges: [
      {
        title: "Kitchen Fire Damage",
        description: "Kitchen fires—from cooking, grease, or electrical issues—are the most common house fires. Even contained kitchen fires produce smoke that travels throughout the home via HVAC systems. The kitchen may require complete renovation while smoke damage affects rooms on all floors.",
        solution: "We address smoke infiltration throughout the home, not just the kitchen. HVAC systems are cleaned to prevent recirculating smoke particles. Odor treatment reaches every room affected by smoke migration."
      },
      {
        title: "Smoke Migration in Split-Levels",
        description: "Kings Park and Mantua split-levels have connected air spaces between levels. Smoke from a lower-level fire rises through the open stairway and infiltrates the entire upper level. The ceiling cavity connecting levels becomes a smoke pathway affecting bedrooms far from the fire origin.",
        solution: "We clean all levels affected by smoke migration, treating ceiling cavities and HVAC pathways. Split-level smoke damage often requires treating every room in the home, regardless of where the fire started."
      },
      {
        title: "Water Damage from Firefighting",
        description: "Fire trucks pump water at high volume to suppress fires. A kitchen fire might require thousands of gallons that soak through floors into lower levels. Your Burke split-level kitchen fire may result in a flooded lower-level family room from firefighting water.",
        solution: "We extract firefighting water as a priority, often while fire damage assessment is still underway. Quick extraction prevents the mold growth that would add another layer of damage to your restoration."

        title: "Soot Corrosion Damage",
        description: "Soot isn't just dirty—it contains corrosive compounds that continue damaging surfaces after the fire. Metal fixtures, appliances, and electronics suffer progressive corrosion. Painted surfaces yellow. Quick cleaning prevents permanent damage.",
        solution: "We prioritize soot cleaning in the first days after fire damage. Surfaces cleaned quickly can often be restored; surfaces left sooty for weeks may require replacement instead of cleaning."

      {
        title: "Contents Restoration",
        description: "Fire and smoke damage affects not just your home but everything in it. Clothing absorbs smoke odor. Electronics suffer soot contamination. Documents and photographs need specialized cleaning. Many personal items can be saved with proper treatment.",
        solution: "We can pack out contents for off-site cleaning and storage, or clean items on-site depending on damage and your needs. Contents restoration often saves irreplaceable personal items and reduces replacement costs."

    headline: "Fire Damage Restoration Costs in Fairfax",
    intro: "Fire damage costs vary enormously based on fire size, smoke spread, and water damage from firefighting. A contained kitchen fire might cost $10,000-25,000 for cleaning and limited reconstruction. Major fires requiring complete renovation of affected areas can exceed $100,000. Homeowner's insurance covers most fire damage restoration.",
    factors: [
      "Extent of fire damage—contained fire vs. spread through multiple rooms",
      "Smoke infiltration—limited to origin area vs. throughout the home via HVAC",
      "Water damage from firefighting—surface wetness vs. saturated structure",
      "Contents damage—on-site cleaning vs. pack-out for off-site restoration",
      "Reconstruction scope—cosmetic repairs vs. major rebuilding"

      question: "When can restoration start after a fire?",
      answer: "We can respond as soon as the fire department clears the scene—often the same day as the fire. Immediate response for board-up, water extraction, and assessment prevents additional damage. The sooner restoration begins, the more can often be saved."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my whole house smell like smoke when the fire was only in the kitchen?",
      answer: "Smoke travels through air movement and HVAC systems. Even a contained fire produces smoke that migrates throughout the home within minutes. Restoration must address smoke infiltration in every affected room, not just the fire origin."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my smoke-damaged belongings be saved?",
      answer: "Many items can be saved with professional cleaning. Clothing, furniture, and soft goods often respond well to smoke odor treatment. Electronics may be salvageable if cleaned before soot causes corrosion. We assess what can be saved and recommend appropriate cleaning methods."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the smoke smell ever go away?",
      answer: "Yes, with proper treatment. Masking odors doesn't work—the smell returns. Professional odor elimination using ozone, hydroxyl, or thermal fogging neutralizes odor molecules permanently. We treat until odor is eliminated, not just reduced."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "Yes. Homeowner's insurance covers fire damage including cleanup, restoration, and reconstruction. It often covers contents cleaning or replacement and additional living expenses while you're displaced. We document everything and work directly with insurance carriers."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does fire damage restoration take?",
      answer: "Timelines vary dramatically. A small kitchen fire might be cleaned and dried within 1-2 weeks. Larger fires requiring extensive reconstruction can take 2-6 months. We provide realistic timelines after comprehensive assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I try to clean soot myself before you arrive?",
      answer: "No. Improper cleaning can embed soot into surfaces, making later restoration more difficult or impossible. Soot cleaning requires specific techniques and products for different materials. Wait for professional assessment and cleaning."
