    paragraphs: [
      `Your Fairfax colonial isn't just a house—it's where your kids learned to ride bikes, where Thanksgiving dinners happen, and where twenty years of family memories live in the walls. When water invades your Burke Centre townhome or Kings Park split-level, it threatens more than drywall and carpet. It disrupts the place your family calls home.

Flood Doctor has served Fairfax families since 2005, restoring water-damaged homes throughout Burke, Fairfax City, Mantua, and beyond. We've pumped flooded basements in Burke Centre after summer storms, dried split-levels in Kings Park when washing machine lines burst, and saved colonial hardwood floors in Fairfax Station before insurance adjusters even arrived. When your neighbor recommends a restoration company, they mention us—because we've already handled their sump pump failure or burst pipe emergency.`,

      `Fairfax's water damage challenges reflect the community's housing stock. The colonials and split-levels built in the 1970s and 1980s now face aging infrastructure—original sump pumps that fail during heavy rain, HVAC drain lines that clog after decades of service, and supply lines that finally give out. The mature trees that shade Burke Lake Park also send roots into clay sewer pipes, creating backups when storms hit. The same sloped lots that provide great yards also channel water toward foundation walls.

Our IICRC-certified technicians understand Fairfax homes. We know Burke Centre townhomes share HVAC systems that can spread water damage between units. We've dried hundreds of split-level basements where water pools at the lowest level. We understand that your Fairfax City home's value depends on fast, thorough restoration—not just pumping water and hoping for the best.`

    localContext: "Fairfax's family neighborhoods—from Burke's established subdivisions to Fairfax City's charming downtown—deserve restoration experts who understand how people actually live in these homes. We've protected family investments throughout Fairfax County since 2005."

        description: "Fairfax's popular split-level design creates a unique problem: the lowest level sits partially below grade, and water naturally flows downward. When sump pumps fail or foundation seepage occurs, water pools in the lowest living space—often a family room or bedroom.",

      question: "How fast should I call after finding water damage in my Fairfax home?",
      answer: "Call immediately—within minutes if possible. Water damage worsens hour by hour. Drywall absorbs water, wood floors begin warping, and mold can start growing within 24 hours. In Fairfax's humid climate, fast action makes the difference between minor restoration and major reconstruction. Call (703) 656-0104 the moment you discover water."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save my hardwood floors after basement flooding?",
      answer: "Often yes, especially if we respond quickly. Fairfax colonials often feature quality hardwood that responds well to professional drying. The key is rapid water removal and controlled drying—not blast-heating the floors, which causes cupping. We've saved hardwood floors throughout Burke, Kings Park, and Fairfax Station by drying them properly."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover this water damage?",
      answer: "Coverage depends on the water source and your policy. Sudden burst pipes are typically covered; gradual seepage from poor maintenance usually isn't. Sump pump failures may require separate coverage. We work directly with insurance companies, help document damage, and can explain what your adjuster needs to approve your claim."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will drying take in my split-level home?",
      answer: "Typically 3-5 days for most Fairfax split-levels, depending on damage extent. Split-level construction can slow drying because water often travels to the lowest level and affects multiple areas. We monitor daily and won't rush the process—proper drying prevents mold growth that shows up weeks later."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with Burke Centre HOAs?",
      answer: "Yes, we regularly work with Burke Centre and other Fairfax HOAs. We provide the documentation HOAs require, coordinate with property managers, and understand multi-unit implications. If your townhome water damage might affect neighbors, we'll help coordinate the entire response."
    },
    {
      question: "What if water damaged my kids' bedrooms or playroom?",
      answer: "We prioritize getting family spaces back in service. If water affected bedrooms, we'll dry those areas first when possible. We can work around school schedules, protect toys and belongings during drying, and help coordinate temporary sleeping arrangements if needed. Family-focused service is what we do."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I try to clean up the water myself before you arrive?",
      answer: "Remove small items and valuables from wet areas, but don't attempt major cleanup. Don't use your household vacuum (electrical hazard), and don't pull up carpet yourself (you might damage it unnecessarily). Let us handle extraction with professional equipment—it's safer and more effective."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between you and a national chain?",
      answer: "We're locally owned and Fairfax-focused. We know Burke Centre's townhome construction, Kings Park's split-level layouts, and Fairfax City's older housing stock. National chains dispatch from central locations and lack local expertise. We're positioned specifically to serve Fairfax families quickly."
