    headline: "Fairfax Storm Damage Emergency Response",
    paragraphs: [
      `When a summer derecho tears through Fairfax at 70 miles per hour, the damage unfolds in minutes. Trees crash through roofs in Burke. Power lines fall across streets in Kings Park. Rain pours into living rooms where windows used to be. Within an hour, the neighborhood that felt so permanent looks like a disaster zone. And for Fairfax families standing in their damaged homes, the question is the same: who do we call?

Flood Doctor has responded to storm damage throughout Fairfax for nearly two decades. We were there after the 2012 derecho, after countless tropical storm remnants, and after the microbursts that seem to target specific neighborhoods with uncanny precision. When Mantua's mature oaks bring down power lines and Burke Centre's tree canopy lands on rooftops, our crews deploy across the community—tarping, extracting, drying, and helping families start the recovery process.`,

      `Storm damage is chaotic. A single event can bring roof damage, wind-driven rain intrusion, flooding from overwhelmed drainage, and power outages that disable sump pumps. Your Burke colonial might have a tree through the roof while water pours into the basement from a failed sump. Your Kings Park split-level might have intact structure but three inches of rainwater on the lower level. Each situation requires different response—and often multiple responses simultaneously.

Our IICRC-certified crews are trained for the complete spectrum of storm damage. We coordinate tarping with extraction with drying with debris removal. We work during the chaos of active storms, reaching homes while rain is still falling. And we handle the insurance documentation that Fairfax families need to recover—photos, measurements, logs, and estimates that support complete claims.`

    localContext: "Fairfax faces regular storm threats: summer thunderstorms and derechos, tropical system remnants, winter ice storms, and occasional tornado touchdowns. The mature tree canopy that makes our neighborhoods beautiful also creates falling hazards during high winds."

        number: 5,
        title: "Structural Drying",

      {
        title: "Mature Tree Damage",
        description: "The beautiful tree canopy throughout Burke, Kings Park, and Mantua becomes a hazard during high winds. Mature oaks and maples can bring thousands of pounds crashing through roofs, into walls, and onto vehicles. The tree-lined streets that drew you to Fairfax create storm vulnerability.",
        solution: "We work with tree removal services during major events—our water damage crews following behind tree crews to tarp, extract, and dry before rain causes additional damage. Rapid coordination minimizes total damage from tree strikes."
      },
      {
        title: "Summer Derecho Events",
        description: "Derechos—widespread, fast-moving windstorms—have hit the DC region multiple times in recent decades. The 2012 derecho caused catastrophic damage across Fairfax with winds exceeding 70 mph. Trees fell across roads, power was out for days, and thousands of homes suffered damage simultaneously.",
        solution: "We maintain disaster response capacity for widespread events. During derechos, we triage by severity, reaching the most endangered structures first while queuing less urgent calls for rapid follow-up. Our resources scale for community-wide events."
      },
      {
        title: "Wind-Driven Rain Intrusion",
        description: "Even without structural damage, high winds can drive rain through gaps around windows, doors, and roof penetrations that normally stay dry. This wind-driven intrusion soaks window frames, walls, and flooring in ways homeowners don't expect from an apparently intact structure.",
        solution: "We use thermal imaging to find moisture from wind-driven rain intrusion. This damage is often hidden inside walls until it causes visible damage or mold. Early detection and drying prevents larger problems."
      },
      {
        title: "Power Outage Sump Failures",
        description: "Extended power outages disable sump pumps right when rain is heaviest. During the hours or days without power, groundwater rises and basements flood. Many Fairfax homeowners discover their lower levels flooded when they return home after waiting out the storm elsewhere.",
        solution: "We respond immediately when power restoration reveals flooding. Our extraction and drying equipment runs on generators when needed. After storms, we recommend battery backup sump systems to protect during future outages."
      },
      {
        title: "Ice Dam Roof Damage",
        description: "Fairfax's occasional significant snowfalls create ice dam risks on colonial roofs. When snow piles up and refreezes at roof edges, ice dams form and trap melting water. That water backs up under shingles and leaks through ceilings, often in multiple rooms simultaneously.",
        solution: "We respond to ice dam damage with ceiling extraction, insulation removal if needed, and structural drying. After drying, proper attic insulation and ventilation improvements can prevent ice dam recurrence."

    headline: "Storm Damage Restoration Costs in Fairfax",
    intro: "Storm damage costs vary dramatically based on the type and extent of damage. Emergency tarping might cost $500-1,500. Complete water damage restoration from roof leaks or flooding ranges from $3,000 to $15,000+. Structural damage from tree strikes can exceed $50,000 including reconstruction. Homeowner's insurance typically covers sudden storm damage.",
    factors: [
      "Type of damage—roof damage, water intrusion, flooding, or structural damage each have different costs",
      "Extent affected—a single room vs. multiple floors changes scope significantly",
      "Emergency response timing—tarping during active weather prevents additional damage and costs",
      "Materials damaged—ceiling drywall, insulation, flooring, and personal property affect totals",
      "Reconstruction needs—minor drywall repair vs. major structural reconstruction"

      question: "A tree just came through my roof—what should I do?",
      answer: "First, ensure everyone is safe and evacuate the affected area if necessary. If it's actively raining, move belongings away from the damaged area. Call (703) 656-0104—we'll dispatch immediately for emergency tarping. Don't try to move the tree yourself; it may be unstable or entangled with the structure."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work during active storms?",
      answer: "Yes, when conditions allow safe travel. We don't send crews into dangerous situations, but we work through heavy rain, minor debris, and challenging conditions to reach homes that need help. During severe events, we deploy as soon as the most dangerous conditions pass."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover storm damage?",
      answer: "Yes—homeowner's insurance typically covers sudden storm damage including wind, falling trees, and resulting water damage. Flooding from rising water may require separate flood insurance. We document everything to support your claim and work directly with insurance carriers."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle storm damage affecting multiple areas of my home?",
      answer: "We prioritize and parallelize. Tarping to stop rain entry comes first. Then we extract standing water while also setting up drying equipment. Multiple crew members address different damage zones simultaneously. Storm damage requires coordinated, multi-front response."
    },
    {
      question: "Our power has been out for two days and our basement flooded—can you help?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We respond to post-storm flooding discoveries regularly. Our equipment can run on generators if power is still out. The sooner we extract water and begin drying, the less secondary damage from mold will occur. Call immediately when you discover flooding."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with both water damage and the structural repairs?",
      answer: "We handle all water damage aspects—extraction, drying, mold prevention. For major structural repairs like roof replacement or wall reconstruction, we can recommend and coordinate with trusted Fairfax contractors. We manage the water damage while they handle structural rebuilding."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does storm damage restoration take?",
      answer: "Emergency tarping and water extraction happen within hours. Structural drying typically takes 3-5 days. Full restoration—including reconstruction of damaged areas—can take weeks depending on damage extent and contractor availability. We can provide timelines after assessment."
