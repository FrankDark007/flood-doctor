    headline: "Fairfax Burst Pipe Emergency Response",
    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe in your Fairfax home releases hundreds of gallons of water in minutes. Whether it's a frozen pipe that finally gives way in your Kings Park colonial, a washing machine supply line that bursts in your Burke townhome, or an aging copper pipe that splits in your Mantua split-level, the damage happens fast. Water floods floors, soaks into walls, and threatens ceilings below.

Flood Doctor responds to burst pipe emergencies throughout Fairfax 24 hours a day. We've handled frozen pipe bursts during winter cold snaps, washing machine line failures in Burke Centre townhomes, and corroded supply lines that finally failed in Fairfax City's older homes. When you discover a burst pipe at 3 AM, we answer the phone—and we arrive with everything needed to stop the damage and start restoration.`,

      `Fairfax's burst pipe challenges reflect the area's housing age and construction. Homes built in the 1970s and 1980s throughout Burke, Kings Park, and Mantua now feature aging copper supply lines that corrode from inside. Washing machine supply lines—often overlooked during home maintenance—burst without warning, flooding laundry rooms and adjacent spaces. Winter freezes impact pipes in unheated crawl spaces, exterior walls, and garage locations.

Our burst pipe response combines emergency water extraction with permanent repair coordination. We don't just pump water and leave—we help you understand why the pipe burst, what needs replacing, and how to prevent the next failure. Fairfax families need solutions, not just cleanup.`
    ],
    localContext: "Fairfax's 30-50 year old housing stock—from Burke's family neighborhoods to Fairfax Station's colonials—faces increasing burst pipe risk as infrastructure ages. We've responded to thousands of burst pipe emergencies throughout Fairfax County since 2005."

      {
        title: "Washing Machine Supply Line Failures",
        description: "Rubber washing machine supply lines have a typical lifespan of 5-7 years, but many Fairfax homes still use original lines installed 10-20 years ago. When these lines finally burst, they release water at full supply pressure—often flooding laundry rooms, adjacent bathrooms, and spaces below.",
        solution: "We extract water immediately and assess damage to all adjacent areas. Laundry rooms in Fairfax homes often sit near kitchens, bathrooms, or above finished basements. We trace all water migration and dry thoroughly. Then we recommend stainless steel braided supply line replacement."

      {
        title: "Frozen Pipe Bursts in Winter",
        description: "Fairfax winters bring occasional hard freezes that impact pipes in unheated crawl spaces, exterior walls, and garage locations. Pipes freeze solid, then burst when they thaw. The burst often isn't discovered until water starts flowing—sometimes hours or days after the actual break.",
        solution: "Frozen pipe bursts require comprehensive assessment because water may have been flowing for extended periods before discovery. We check all levels for water damage, not just the obvious areas. We also identify vulnerable pipe locations and recommend insulation upgrades."

      {
        title: "Aging Copper Pipe Corrosion",
        description: "Copper supply pipes in Burke, Kings Park, and Mantua homes built 30-50 years ago corrode from inside due to water chemistry. Pinhole leaks develop first, then sections fail completely. These failures often occur in wall cavities or ceiling spaces—hidden until water appears.",
        solution: "We use thermal imaging to trace the water source when pipes fail inside walls. We coordinate with plumbers to access and repair the burst section. If your home has multiple copper pipe issues, we'll explain when whole-house repiping makes more sense than repeated repairs."

      {
        title: "Split-Level Multi-Floor Impact",
        description: "Burst pipes in Fairfax split-levels send water across multiple levels. A second-floor bathroom supply line burst affects the bathroom, travels through the main level, and often reaches the lower level. Water follows gravity and finds every pathway down.",
        solution: "Our assessment includes all levels below the burst location. We dry everything affected—not just where water is visible. Split-level construction creates hidden water paths that only experience and equipment can identify."

        title: "Burke Centre Townhome Shared Wall Concerns",
        description: "Burst pipes in Burke Centre townhomes can impact shared walls with adjacent units. Water doesn't respect property lines—it flows where gravity and construction allow. HOA coordination becomes necessary when water affects neighbors.",
        solution: "We communicate with HOA management and affected neighbors immediately. We provide documentation for multiple insurance claims when needed. Our extraction and drying address shared wall concerns to protect both your unit and adjacent properties."

    {
      question: "My washing machine supply line just burst—what do I do right now?",
      answer: "Turn off the water supply to the washing machine immediately—usually shutoff valves are on the wall behind the machine. If you can't reach them, turn off your main water supply. Move items from wet areas if safe. Then call (703) 656-0104 immediately. Don't try to mop up the water yourself—we'll extract it properly with professional equipment."
    },
    {
      question: "How much water does a burst pipe release?",
      answer: "A typical residential supply line releases 2-10 gallons per minute at normal pressure. A washing machine supply line can release 5-10 gallons per minute. That means even 10 minutes of flow releases 50-100 gallons—enough to flood multiple rooms. Fast shutoff and professional extraction are critical."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover burst pipe damage?",
      answer: "Most homeowner policies cover sudden burst pipe events—frozen pipes, supply line failures, and washing machine line bursts. Damage from gradual leaks or lack of maintenance usually isn't covered. We document everything for your claim and work directly with adjusters to support approval."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you fix the pipe or just the water damage?",
      answer: "We coordinate with licensed plumbers for permanent pipe repair but focus on water damage restoration ourselves. We'll help arrange qualified plumbers we trust throughout Fairfax. Our expertise is extracting water, drying your home, and preventing mold—we leave plumbing repair to licensed plumbers."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does drying take after a burst pipe?",
      answer: "Typically 3-5 days for most Fairfax homes, depending on water volume and affected materials. Burst pipes that ran for hours before discovery take longer than those shut off quickly. We monitor daily and won't rush the process—thorough drying prevents mold."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the pipe burst in my wall—how do you find it?",
      answer: "We use thermal imaging cameras that detect temperature differences created by water in wall cavities. This lets us locate the burst pipe source without cutting random holes in walls. Once located, plumbers can access the exact spot for repair."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I replace all my washing machine supply lines?",
      answer: "If your current lines are rubber and more than 5 years old, yes. Stainless steel braided lines cost $15-30 and last much longer. They're the single best prevention against washing machine line bursts. We recommend replacement for all Fairfax homes with original rubber lines."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you respond at night to burst pipe emergencies?",
      answer: "Yes, 24/7/365. A burst pipe at 2 AM gets the same immediate response as daytime calls. Water damage worsens hour by hour—we don't make you wait until morning while water floods your home. Call (703) 656-0104 any time."
