    headline: "Fairfax Storm Flooding & Flash Flood Cleanup",
    paragraphs: [
      `When a July thunderstorm dumps three inches of rain on Fairfax in an hour, drainage systems can't keep up. Streets flash flood. Backyards become lakes. And the lower levels of Kings Park split-levels, Burke Centre townhomes, and Mantua colonials fill with muddy stormwater before families can move their belongings. These aren't once-in-a-decade events—Fairfax sees flooding like this every summer.

Flood Doctor has responded to storm flooding throughout Fairfax for nearly two decades. We've pumped out Burke basements after summer deluges, extracted floodwater from Kings Park lower levels during tropical storm remnants, and cleaned up the mess left behind when Difficult Run overflows into Mantua backyards. When weathering the storm turns into flood damage, Fairfax families know to call us.`,

      `Flood cleanup after storms presents challenges that routine water damage doesn't. Stormwater carries silt, debris, and contamination from overloaded drains and rising groundwater. The water in your Burke family room isn't clean—it's Category 2 or 3 water requiring more intensive cleanup protocols. Saturated clay soil continues pushing groundwater against your foundation for days after the storm passes.

Our IICRC-certified crews are trained in flood-specific cleanup. We don't just extract water—we remove contaminated debris, treat surfaces with antimicrobials, and ensure complete drying to prevent the mold growth that follows flood damage. For Fairfax families facing flood cleanup while also dealing with downed trees, power outages, and neighborhood chaos, we handle the indoor crisis so you can focus on everything else.`
    ],
    localContext: "Fairfax's summer thunderstorms and tropical weather systems create regular flooding risks. The clay soil, aging drainage infrastructure, and partially below-grade family rooms common in our neighborhoods make professional flood cleanup essential."

      {
        title: "Summer Thunderstorm Flash Flooding",
        description: "Fairfax's summer weather pattern brings intense afternoon thunderstorms that can drop 2-4 inches of rain in an hour. Storm drains backup, streets flash flood, and water pours into lower-level living spaces faster than sump pumps can handle. These events happen multiple times each summer.",
        solution: "We respond during active storms, not after. Our crews reach flooded homes within 30 minutes, often extracting water while rain is still falling. Quick response minimizes damage and contamination penetration."
      },
      {
        title: "Clay Soil Drainage Problems",
        description: "The clay soil throughout Burke, Kings Park, and Mantua doesn't absorb water quickly. During heavy rain, water pools against foundations and seeps through the smallest cracks. Even after rain stops, saturated clay continues pushing groundwater into lower levels for days.",
        solution: "We maintain drying equipment until soil moisture normalizes—not just until visible water is gone. We also document drainage issues that may require grading, French drain, or waterproofing solutions to prevent recurring flooding."
      },
      {
        title: "Overwhelmed Sump Systems",
        description: "Sump pumps in Fairfax homes are sized for normal groundwater, not flood events. When storms dump inches of rain quickly, pumps can't keep up with the inflow. Some run continuously for hours and burn out. Others trip breakers. Many simply can't pump fast enough.",
        solution: "We extract water that overwhelmed sump systems couldn't handle. After restoration, we recommend pump upgrades—larger capacity, battery backup, or dual-pump systems for Fairfax's flood-prone areas."
      },
      {
        title: "Contaminated Stormwater",
        description: "Floodwater isn't clean water. It picks up lawn chemicals, motor oil from driveways, sewage from overwhelmed systems, and bacteria from standing water. This Category 2 or 3 contamination requires more intensive cleanup than a simple pipe burst.",
        solution: "We treat flood cleanup as contaminated water events. All affected surfaces receive antimicrobial treatment. Porous materials that absorbed contaminated water—carpet padding, insulation, some drywall—are removed and replaced."

        title: "Multi-Neighborhood Flooding",
        description: "Major storms affect entire neighborhoods simultaneously. When Burke Centre floods, dozens of townhomes need help. Our resources can be stretched thin during widespread events, and access roads may be flooded.",
        solution: "We pre-position crews and equipment during forecast severe weather. We triage calls by severity during widespread events, reaching the worst situations first while queuing less urgent calls for rapid follow-up."

    headline: "Flood Cleanup Costs in Fairfax",
    intro: "Flood cleanup costs more than clean water damage due to contamination treatment requirements. Costs depend on water depth, affected square footage, and contamination level. Most Fairfax flood damage is covered by homeowner's insurance; flood zone properties may require separate flood insurance.",

      "Contamination category—Category 2 gray water vs. Category 3 black water affects treatment protocols",
      "Square footage affected—larger lower levels and basements require more equipment and time",
      "Material damage—contaminated carpet and drywall usually require removal rather than restoration",
      "Debris volume—heavy silting and flood debris add cleanup time and disposal costs",
      "Access conditions—flooding that blocks equipment access or requires pumping from distance adds complexity"

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "Is stormwater flooding covered by my homeowner's insurance?",
      answer: "It depends on the source. Water entering through foundation cracks or backed-up drains is typically covered. Rising floodwater from overflowing creeks or flash flooding may require separate flood insurance. We document the water entry points carefully to support your claim."
    },
    {
      question: "How is flood cleanup different from regular water damage?",
      answer: "Stormwater is contaminated—it picks up lawn chemicals, sewage from overwhelmed systems, and bacteria from standing water. We treat flood cleanup as Category 2 or 3 water events, using antimicrobial treatment and removing porous materials that absorbed contaminated water."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save my flooded carpet?",
      answer: "Probably not after storm flooding. Contaminated floodwater saturates carpet padding, which is nearly impossible to adequately clean and dry. We typically remove and dispose of carpet and padding from flood-affected areas. Your insurance should cover replacement."
    },
    {
      question: "How long after a storm can I wait to call for flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Call immediately. Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours in saturated materials. Contaminated floodwater causes more damage the longer it sits. Even if water has receded, the drying and treatment process should start as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my basement flood every time it rains hard?",
      answer: "Recurring flooding suggests underlying drainage issues. Common causes include aging sump pumps, clogged drain tiles, poor grading around the foundation, or overwhelmed storm drainage systems. After immediate cleanup, we can document issues and recommend permanent solutions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you respond during an active storm?",
      answer: "Yes. We dispatch during storms and drive through flooding when safely possible. We won't send crews into dangerous conditions, but we reach homes as quickly as conditions allow. During severe weather, we pre-position crews throughout Fairfax for faster response."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take?",
      answer: "Extraction takes a few hours once we arrive. Antimicrobial treatment and drying typically take 5-7 days due to the contamination involved. Reconstruction after drying depends on the extent of damage and may take additional weeks."
