  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Burke Centre is one of Northern Virginia's most successful planned communities—beautifully landscaped neighborhoods, strong HOA management, and homes that retain their value decade after decade. When water threatens your Burke Centre townhome or single-family home, you need restoration experts who understand both the construction and the community coordination required.

Flood Doctor has served Burke Centre families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from townhome basements after summer storms, dried shared-wall structures with neighboring units in mind, and worked with Burke Centre Conservancy on multi-unit water events. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Burke Centre—when you call at 3 AM about a sump pump failure, we're already nearby.

Burke Centre's townhome construction creates unique challenges. Shared walls mean water damage in one unit can affect neighbors. HOA coordination is essential for exterior access and community documentation. Finished basements in these 1980s-era homes have aging sump pumps and plumbing approaching failure age. We understand all of these factors and handle them professionally.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "How do you handle Burke Centre townhome water damage?",
      answer: "We respond immediately to contain water within your unit. If water has crossed into a neighboring unit, we communicate with that homeowner and document the situation for both insurance claims. We're experienced with multi-unit coordination in townhome communities."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with Burke Centre Conservancy?",
      answer: "Yes. We're familiar with Burke Centre's HOA structure and requirements. We provide any documentation the Conservancy needs and coordinate exterior access when required. We've worked in Burke Centre for nearly two decades."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do Burke Centre basements flood?",
      answer: "Most flooding relates to sump pump issues. Burke Centre homes were built from 1977-1990s with sump systems now 30-45 years old. Original pumps fail, power outages disable pumps during storms, and heavy rain overwhelms undersized systems. After restoration, we recommend pump evaluation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if water damage affects my neighbor's unit?",
      answer: "We document everything and can coordinate service for multiple units when needed. Each unit typically files its own insurance claim, but we help with the documentation that clarifies the water's origin. We've handled many multi-unit Burke Centre situations."
