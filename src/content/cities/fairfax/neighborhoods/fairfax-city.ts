  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Fairfax City isn't just another Fairfax County suburb—it's an independent city with its own character, from the historic courthouse to the thriving downtown along Main Street. When water threatens your Fairfax City home, you need restoration experts who understand both the older housing stock near Old Town and the newer developments around Fairfax Corner.

Flood Doctor has served Fairfax City families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements along Chain Bridge Road, dried finished lower levels near George Mason University, and protected the original hardwood floors in colonials throughout the city. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Fairfax City—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here ranges from 1950s-era colonials in established neighborhoods to 1990s construction near Fairfax Corner. Older homes have charm but also aging plumbing, original sump pumps, and construction methods that require experienced restoration approaches. We treat each Fairfax City property with the care these community homes deserve.`,
