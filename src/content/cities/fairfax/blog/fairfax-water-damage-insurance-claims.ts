    introduction: `Water damage is one of the most common homeowner insurance claims—and one of the most frequently disputed. Understanding what your policy covers, how to document damage properly, and what mistakes to avoid can mean the difference between full coverage and a denied claim.

This guide helps Fairfax homeowners navigate the water damage claims process successfully.`,

        heading: "What's Typically Covered",
        content: `Standard homeowner policies cover many—but not all—water damage scenarios:

**Usually covered:**
- Burst pipes from freezing
- Sudden appliance failures (washing machine, water heater, dishwasher)
- Accidental overflow from plumbing fixtures
- Water damage from firefighting efforts
- Storm-driven rain through damaged roof
- Damage to building structure from covered causes
- Personal property damaged by covered water events

**Usually NOT covered:**
- Flood damage from rising water (requires separate flood insurance)
- Gradual leaks you should have noticed and repaired
- Water damage from deferred maintenance
- Sewer backup (requires endorsement)
- Damage from neglected repairs
- The cost to repair the item that failed (pipe, appliance, etc.)
- Mold (limited or excluded in many policies)

**Coverage gray areas:**
- Overflow from clogged drains (depends on cause)
- Ice dam damage (coverage varies by policy)
- Foundation seepage (usually excluded)
- Sump pump failure (may require endorsement)

**Check your specific policy:**
Coverage varies significantly between insurers and policy types. Review your declarations page and policy language—don't assume coverage based on general information.`

        heading: "Documentation That Supports Your Claim",
        content: `Proper documentation is the foundation of a successful claim:

**Before cleanup (critical):**
- Photograph all affected areas from multiple angles
- Video walkthrough showing water levels and spread
- Photos of the damage source if visible
- Document water on floors, walls, furniture
- Photograph any valuables or personal property affected
- Note the date and time of discovery

**During the event:**
- Document when you shut off water
- Note when you called for help
- Record all emergency mitigation steps taken
- Keep records of items moved or protected
- Save receipts for any emergency expenses

**After professional response:**
- Moisture readings and reports
- Photos of hidden damage discovered
- Inventory of damaged items
- Professional assessment reports
- Invoices for all restoration work

**For personal property claims:**
- List each damaged item
- Include age and original purchase price if possible
- Photos of damage to each item
- Receipts if available (check email for online purchases)
- Note replacement cost

**Documentation don'ts:**
- Don't throw away damaged items before documenting
- Don't clean up completely before photographing
- Don't wait to document—conditions change
- Don't assume the insurance adjuster will see everything`

        heading: "Common Claim Mistakes to Avoid",
        content: `These mistakes frequently lead to claim denials or reductions:

**Waiting too long to report:**
Most policies require prompt notification. Delayed reporting raises questions and can void coverage.

**Inadequate documentation:**
Without photos and documentation from before cleanup, it's your word against the adjuster's assessment. Document first, clean second.

**Throwing away damaged items:**
The insurance company may want to inspect damaged items. Keep them until the claim is settled, even if they're ruined.

**Admitting fault or speculation:**
Don't speculate about causes or admit negligence. Stick to facts: "I discovered water at this time in this location."

**Failing to mitigate:**
You're required to prevent additional damage. If you don't take reasonable mitigation steps, additional damage may not be covered.

**Unauthorized repairs:**
Emergency mitigation is expected, but don't complete permanent repairs before the adjuster inspects. You may not be reimbursed.

**Accepting the first offer:**
The initial settlement offer is negotiable. If it doesn't cover actual costs, provide documentation and negotiate.

**Not reading your policy:**
Understanding your coverage before a claim helps you know what to expect and what to argue for.

**DIY restoration for significant damage:**
Professional restoration provides documentation and thoroughness that supports your claim. DIY approaches may leave damage that surfaces later.`

        heading: "When Claims Get Complicated",
        content: `Some situations require extra attention:

**Gradual vs. sudden damage:**
Insurance covers sudden damage, not gradual deterioration. If the insurer claims damage was gradual:
- Document sudden discovery
- Provide professional assessment of failure timeline
- Show evidence of regular maintenance
- Get expert opinion if needed

**Mold coverage:**
Mold coverage is often limited or excluded. Strategies include:
- Document that mold resulted from covered water damage
- Show prompt response to water event
- Professional documentation of mold origin
- Review policy language carefully

**Disputed damage extent:**
If you believe damage is more extensive than the adjuster assessed:
- Get independent contractor estimates
- Request a second adjuster inspection
- Provide moisture readings and professional reports
- Consider a public adjuster for large claims

**Claim denials:**
If your claim is denied:
- Request the denial in writing with specific reasons
- Review policy language for the cited exclusion
- Provide additional documentation addressing the denial reason
- Appeal through the company's internal process
- Consider state insurance department complaint
- Consult an attorney for significant claims

**Sewer backup claims:**
Standard policies often exclude sewer backup. If you have the endorsement:
- Document backup carefully
- Note whether contamination is present
- Professional categorization matters for coverage`
