        heading: "First 5 Minutes: Safety and Water Shutoff",
        content: `**Priority 1: Ensure everyone is safe.**
- Account for all family members
- Keep children and pets away from water
- If water is near electrical outlets, don't enter until power is off

**Priority 2: Stop the water source.**

*If you can identify the source:*
- Appliance failure: Turn off water supply valves behind the appliance
- Toilet overflow: Close the shutoff valve behind the toilet
- Under-sink leak: Close hot and cold valves under the sink
- Water heater: Close the cold water inlet valve

*If you can't find the source or can't stop it:*
Turn off your main water shutoff. In Fairfax homes, it's typically located:
- In the basement near where the water line enters
- Near the water meter
- In a utility closet
- Near the front of the house

**Know your shutoff now.** Walk through your home today and locate it. Make sure everyone in your household knows where it is.

**Priority 3: Electrical safety.**
- If water is near electrical outlets, panels, or appliances, turn off power at the breaker
- Never enter standing water when electricity may be present
- If your breaker panel is in or near water, stay away and call an electrician`

        content: `**While waiting for professional help:**

*Move what you can:*
- Lift furniture onto blocks or aluminum foil (prevents staining)
- Move electronics and valuables to dry areas
- Remove area rugs from wet floors
- Empty lower cabinets and closet floors
- Relocate documents and photos

*Slow the spread:*
- Use towels to create barriers at doorways
- Mop up accessible water
- Put containers under active drips
- Open interior doors to improve air circulation

*Document everything:*
- Take photos and video before cleanup
- Document water levels and affected areas
- Photograph the source if visible
- Note the time you discovered the problem

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't use household fans to "dry" significant water
- Don't use a regular vacuum on water
- Don't assume wet carpet will dry on its own
- Don't wait to see if it gets worse`

        heading: "Common Fairfax Water Damage Causes",
        content: `Understanding common causes helps you prevent future incidents:

**Washing machine hose failure:**
The most common cause of major residential water damage. Rubber hoses deteriorate and fail catastrophically, releasing water until discovered. Replace rubber hoses with braided stainless steel versions.

**Water heater failures:**
Tank water heaters have a 10-15 year lifespan. Failures release 40-80 gallons immediately, plus continuous flow until shutoff. Replace proactively and consider tankless alternatives.

**Supply line failures:**
Flexible supply lines under sinks and behind toilets fatigue over time. Replace every 5-7 years, or immediately if you notice bulging or corrosion.

**HVAC condensate problems:**
Air conditioning systems produce condensation that should drain away. Clogged drain lines cause overflow into living spaces, often in attics where damage spreads before discovery.

**Sump pump failures:**
Fairfax properties with basements rely on sump pumps during heavy rain. Pump failures, power outages, and overwhelmed systems cause basement flooding. Battery backup is essential.

**Storm-related damage:**
Heavy rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems, enter through basement windows, or infiltrate through roof damage. Fairfax's clay-heavy soil doesn't drain quickly, increasing basement risk.`

        heading: "Understanding Water Categories",
        content: `Not all water damage is equal. Professionals classify water by contamination level:

**Category 1 (Clean Water):**
- Broken supply lines
- Faucet failures
- Rainwater (initially)
- *Requires:* Extraction, drying, monitoring

**Category 2 (Gray Water):**
- Washing machine overflow
- Dishwasher discharge
- Toilet overflow (urine only)
- *Requires:* Extraction, sanitization, drying

**Category 3 (Black Water):**
- Sewage backup
- Toilet overflow with feces
- Flood water from outside
- Standing water over 48 hours
- *Requires:* Professional remediation, protective equipment, disposal of porous materials

**Important:** Category 1 water becomes Category 2 within 24-48 hours, and Category 3 shortly after. Time matters in water damage response.`

        heading: "Insurance Considerations",
        content: `**Report promptly:**
Contact your insurance company within 24 hours. Most homeowner policies cover sudden water damage, though coverage varies.

**Typically covered:**
- Sudden pipe bursts
- Appliance failures
- Storm-related water entry (with limitations)
- Water extraction and drying
- Damaged personal property

**Typically NOT covered:**
- Gradual leaks you should have noticed
