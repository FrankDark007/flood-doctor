    introduction: `Tysons has experienced explosive residential development over the past decade—new high-rises, townhome communities, and mixed-use buildings have transformed the landscape. While new construction offers modern amenities and fresh materials, it's not immune to water damage. In fact, certain water damage risks are actually higher in new construction due to installation errors, settling, and the pressure of rapid development.

This guide explains what Tysons new construction buyers and owners need to understand about water damage risks.`,

        heading: "Why New Construction Isn't Risk-Free",
        content: `New homes and condos face specific water damage vulnerabilities:

**Construction defects:**
Rapid development timelines create quality risks:
- Rushed installation of plumbing systems
- Improper flashing around windows and roofs
- Incomplete waterproofing of foundations
- HVAC drainage improperly connected
- Caulking and sealing missed or inadequate

**Settling effects:**
New construction settles during the first years:
- Foundation movement opens cracks
- Plumbing connections stress and separate
- Window and door frames shift
- Expansion gaps open or close

**Material failures:**
Even new materials can fail:
- Defective supply lines and hoses
- Manufacturing defects in appliances
- Improperly installed fixtures
- Incompatible materials that degrade quickly

**Systems not fully tested:**
New systems may have issues that only appear under use:
- First heavy rain reveals roof problems
- First cold snap finds insulation gaps
- First extended use stresses plumbing
- First summer reveals HVAC drainage issues

**Builder oversight:**
High-volume builders in Tysons' competitive market may have:
- Subcontractor quality variations
- Inspection delays or shortcuts
- Punch list items incomplete at closing
- Documentation gaps`
