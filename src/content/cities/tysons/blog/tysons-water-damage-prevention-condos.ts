    introduction: `Owning a condo in Tysons means living in close proximity to neighbors above, below, and beside you. Water damage in your unit doesn't just affect you—it can damage neighbors' properties and create liability exposure you might not expect.

The good news: most condo water damage is preventable with regular maintenance and awareness. This guide provides practical steps to protect your Tysons condo.`,

        heading: "Understanding Condo Water Damage Risk",
        content: `Condo living creates unique water damage dynamics:

**You can damage others:**
Water from your unit travels down through floors and walls. A supply line failure in your unit can damage every unit below you. You may be liable for their damage—not just your own.

**Others can damage you:**
Conversely, a neighbor's water issue can flood your unit. You have limited control over neighbors' maintenance habits.

**Shared systems:**
Condos have shared plumbing, HVAC, and building systems. Failures in common areas or building infrastructure can affect your unit without any fault on your part.

**Insurance complexity:**
Multiple policies are involved:
- Your HO-6 policy covers your unit interior
- HOA master policy covers building and common areas
- Neighbors' policies cover their units
- Liability coverage comes into play if you cause damage

**Extended absence risk:**
Many Tysons condo owners travel frequently or own units as investments. Unoccupied units face extended damage if failures occur.

**The stakes:**
A single supply line failure releasing water for 8 hours while you're at work can:
- Destroy your flooring and cabinets
- Damage units below you (potentially multiple floors)
- Flood hallways and common areas
- Result in claims from multiple neighbors
- Create liability exposure in the hundreds of thousands`

        heading: "Supply Line Maintenance: The #1 Prevention",
        content: `Supply lines cause more condo water damage than any other source:

**What are supply lines?**
Flexible lines connecting your plumbing to:
- Under-sink faucets (hot and cold)
- Toilets
- Dishwashers
- Refrigerators with ice makers
- Washing machines

**Why they fail:**
- Rubber and plastic deteriorate over time
- Connections loosen
- Pressure fluctuations stress materials
- Manufacturing defects
- Age (most fail between 5-10 years)

**Prevention protocol:**

*Replace on schedule:*
- Standard rubber hoses: every 3-5 years
- Braided stainless steel: every 5-7 years
- Don't wait for visible wear

*Upgrade to braided stainless steel:*
- More resistant to failure
- Visible wear indicators
- Worth the modest extra cost
- Replace all at once for consistency

*Monthly inspection:*
- Check for bulging or swelling
- Look for corrosion at connections
- Feel for moisture or dampness
- Verify connections are secure
- Note any discoloration

*Know your shutoffs:*
- Individual shutoffs at each fixture
- Unit main shutoff (know where it is)
- How to shut off quickly in emergency`

        heading: "Appliance Water Safety",
        content: `Appliances are the second most common water damage source:

**Washing machines:**
- Use braided stainless steel hoses only
- Turn off supply valves when not in use (or at minimum, when traveling)
- Don't run while away from home
- Inspect hoses and connections monthly
- Replace hoses every 5 years regardless of appearance
- Consider automatic shutoff devices

**Dishwashers:**
- Check supply line condition annually
- Inspect door seal for wear
- Verify proper drainage
- Don't run when away
- Listen for unusual sounds during operation

**Refrigerators with ice makers:**
- Use braided stainless supply line
- Check connection periodically
- Clean up any ice buildup promptly
- Know how to shut off water supply
- Consider shutting off if away extended periods

**Water heaters (if in-unit):**
- Know the age (10-15 year typical lifespan)
- Install drip pan with drain or alarm
- Inspect annually for rust or leaks
- Consider tankless replacement
- Flush annually per manufacturer recommendations

**HVAC systems:**
- Change filters regularly (affects condensate)
- Verify condensate pan drains properly
- Check drain line annually
- Report unusual moisture to management`

        heading: "Water Detection Technology",
        content: `Smart water detection provides early warning:

**Basic water sensors:**
- Place under sinks, behind toilets, near appliances
- Battery-powered units are inexpensive ($15-30 each)
- Alarm sounds when water detected
- Limitation: you must be present to hear alarm

**Smart water sensors:**
- Connect to WiFi
- Send alerts to your phone
- Work when you're away
- Some integrate with home automation
- Cost: $30-80 each

**Automatic shutoff systems:**
- Sensors detect water
- System automatically shuts off water supply
- Prevents extended damage from slow leaks
- Valuable for frequently unoccupied units
- Cost: $200-500+ depending on system

**Whole-unit monitoring:**
- Professional monitoring services
- Leak detection plus temperature and humidity
- 24/7 monitoring with response
- Higher cost but comprehensive protection
- Consider for high-value or frequently unoccupied units

**Placement priorities:**
1. Under kitchen sink
2. Behind washing machine
3. Near water heater (if in-unit)
4. Under bathroom sinks
5. Near dishwasher
6. At refrigerator ice maker line

**When traveling:**
- Verify sensors are functional before departure
- Consider shutting off water at unit main
- Notify building management of extended absence
- Provide emergency contact information`

        heading: "Insurance Protection",
        content: `Proper insurance is your financial safety net:

**HO-6 condo policy essentials:**
- Covers your unit's interior (walls-in)
- Covers personal property
- Covers improvements you've made
- Provides liability coverage
- May cover loss assessment from HOA

**Coverage amounts:**
- Interior coverage should reflect replacement cost
- Personal property coverage at actual levels
- Liability: $300,000 minimum recommended
- Loss assessment: at least $50,000

**Key coverage questions:**
- What's the HOA deductible? (You may be responsible)
- Is there a unit owner deductible assessment?
- Do you have loss of use coverage?
- Is water damage from neighbor's unit covered?
- What mold coverage exists?

**Liability exposure:**
If your water damages neighbors:
- Your liability coverage responds
- Ensure limits are adequate
- Umbrella policy provides additional protection
- Document your maintenance to show diligence

**Documentation for claims:**
- Photos of your unit's condition
- Maintenance records
- Purchase receipts for improvements
- Inventory of personal property
- Records of supply line replacements`

        heading: "When You'll Be Away",
        content: `Extended absences increase risk significantly:

**Before travel:**
- Inspect all supply lines
- Check under sinks for moisture
- Test water sensors
- Consider shutting off water at unit main
- Set HVAC to prevent freeze (winter) or humidity buildup (summer)

**Shut off the water?**
Arguments for:
- Eliminates supply line failure risk
- Peace of mind while away
- Only inconvenience is no ice maker

Arguments against:
- Toilets won't refill (but you're away anyway)
- Ice maker needs water
- Must remember to turn back on

**Recommendation:** For absences longer than 3-4 days, shutting off water is prudent.

**Building notification:**
- Many buildings want to know about extended vacancies
- Provides contact information for emergencies
- Allows building staff to watch for issues
- May be required by HOA rules

**Trusted access:**
- Consider giving someone access
- Building can enter for emergencies anyway
- Trusted neighbor can check periodically
- Provides faster response if issues occur

**Pet sitters and house sitters:**
- Brief them on water shutoffs
- Show them sensor locations
- Provide emergency numbers
- Explain what to do if water appears

**Smart home capabilities:**
- Water sensors that alert remotely
- Smart valves that can be controlled remotely
- Temperature monitoring for freeze prevention
- Security cameras (for multiple purposes)`
