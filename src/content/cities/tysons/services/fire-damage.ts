    paragraphs: [
      `Fire damage in Tysons' urban environment presents complexities that single-family home restoration companies rarely encounter. When a kitchen fire in a Boro luxury unit triggers building-wide fire suppression, the water damage from activated sprinklers often exceeds the fire damage itself—flooding multiple floors through the time it takes firefighters to arrive and reset systems. When an electrical fire in a Class A office suite fills an entire floor with smoke, restoration must address building HVAC systems that have circulated contamination throughout connected spaces.

Flood Doctor provides comprehensive fire damage restoration throughout Tysons' urban core with expertise in both fire damage and the extensive water damage that typically accompanies commercial building fires. We've restored high-rise units after cooking fires triggered sprinkler activation, remediated smoke damage in commercial offices after electrical equipment failures, and coordinated multi-floor restoration after fire suppression system testing accidents. Property managers call us because we understand that high-rise fire damage requires both fire restoration expertise and water damage capabilities.`,

      `Tysons' modern buildings incorporate sophisticated fire suppression systems that protect lives but can cause significant property damage when activated. Sprinkler heads covering 20x20 foot areas release 20-30 gallons per minute until manually shut off—typically 10-20 minutes after fire department arrival. A single activated head in a condo can flood the unit and multiple floors below. Multiple heads in a commercial space can release thousands of gallons before water stops flowing.

Our IICRC-certified technicians are trained in fire, smoke, and water damage restoration—the combined expertise that Tysons fire events demand. We coordinate with fire departments during active scenes, begin water extraction immediately upon clearance, and address smoke damage throughout affected building systems. When fire threatens your Tysons property, you need restoration specialists who understand that fire damage in high-rises means water damage, smoke damage, and complex building system coordination.`
    ],
    localContext: "Tysons' high-rise residential and commercial buildings feature advanced fire suppression systems that protect lives but can cause extensive water damage when activated. We've built fire damage restoration relationships with property managers throughout Tysons Corner, The Boro, Tysons Central, The Mile, and Scotts Run."

        title: "Smoke Migration Through HVAC Systems",
        description: "High-rise HVAC systems that efficiently circulate conditioned air also circulate smoke throughout connected spaces. A fire in one unit can deposit smoke residue in units across the building that share air handling systems. Smoke enters ductwork, accumulates in air handlers, and continues affecting air quality long after fires are extinguished.",
        solution: "We assess entire HVAC systems connected to fire-affected areas, cleaning air handlers, ductwork, and diffusers where smoke has migrated. Our smoke remediation includes building systems, not just visible unit damage—ensuring complete restoration and preventing ongoing air quality issues."

        title: "Multi-Unit Coordination",
        description: "High-rise fire events typically affect multiple units—the fire origin, units damaged by suppression water, and units contaminated by smoke migration. Each unit has different owners, different insurance coverage, and different restoration requirements. Coordinating across these stakeholders while managing unified restoration logistics creates complexity.",
        solution: "We coordinate multi-unit restoration as unified projects while maintaining separate documentation for each affected party. Our team communicates with all unit owners, works within building access schedules, and provides individual documentation supporting separate insurance claims."

      question: "How quickly can you respond after a fire in my Tysons building?",
      answer: "We respond immediately upon fire department scene clearance. For active fires, we can position equipment nearby for immediate deployment. Early response is critical—fire suppression water continues causing damage, smoke residue becomes harder to remove over time, and delays extend restoration timelines. Call us during active fires so we're ready to begin when investigators release the scene."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is there so much water damage from a small fire?",
      answer: "Modern fire suppression systems protect lives but release significant water. A single activated sprinkler head releases 20-30 gallons per minute until manually shut off—typically 15-30 minutes after activation. In Tysons high-rises, this water flows through floor assemblies to units below. Often, suppression water damage exceeds fire damage, making combined fire and water restoration essential."
    },
    {
      question: "Can smoke damage affect units far from the fire?",
      answer: "Yes—high-rise HVAC systems circulate smoke throughout connected spaces. A fire in one unit can deposit smoke residue in units across the building sharing the same air handling system. Our smoke remediation includes assessment and cleaning of HVAC systems, addressing smoke migration that may not be visible in affected spaces but impacts air quality."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle fire damage in commercial offices?",
      answer: "Commercial fire restoration prioritizes business continuity alongside property restoration. We work extended hours and weekends to accelerate recovery, coordinate with tenant operations to stage work allowing partial occupancy, and provide documentation supporting business interruption claims. Our goal is returning your business to operation as quickly as thorough restoration allows."
    },
    {
      question: "Will smoke odors go away on their own?",
      answer: "No—smoke odor penetrates porous materials and can persist indefinitely without proper treatment. Surface cleaning removes visible soot but doesn't eliminate odor absorbed into materials. We use thermal fogging, ozone treatment, and hydroxyl generation to eliminate odors at the molecular level. HVAC cleaning removes odor sources that would otherwise continue contaminating building air."
    },
    {
      question: "Who pays for fire damage in a Tysons condo—me or the HOA?",
      answer: "Responsibility depends on fire cause, location, and governing documents. Generally, your condo insurance covers damage to your unit's interior and contents. HOA master policy covers building structure and common elements. If fire originated in your unit due to negligence, you may face liability for damage to other units. We document fire origin and damage carefully to support all applicable insurance claims."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you restore smoke-damaged electronics and documents?",
      answer: "Many smoke-damaged contents can be restored with proper treatment. Electronics require specialized cleaning to remove conductive soot particles. Documents can often be freeze-dried and cleaned. Textiles respond to professional cleaning and deodorization. We assess contents individually, restoring what's salvageable and documenting total losses for insurance claims."
