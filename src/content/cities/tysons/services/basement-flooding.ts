For large-scale garage flooding, we can deploy multiple pumping units simultaneously to accelerate water removal. We coordinate immediately with building management for access to utility areas and drainage systems. Our teams are experienced with Tysons' major properties and can navigate building access procedures efficiently during emergencies."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you pump water from a Tysons garage while it's still raining?",
        answer: "Yes, our industrial pumping capacity can remove water faster than most rain events add it, even during heavy storms. We assess ongoing water intrusion, establish primary drainage to remove accumulated water, and implement secondary measures to manage continuing inflow. For severe flooding during active storms, we may deploy multiple pumping systems to address both accumulated water and ongoing storm drainage."
      },
      {
        question: "What should building management do immediately when underground flooding occurs?",
        answer: "First, assess electrical safety and shut down power to affected areas if safe to do so.
