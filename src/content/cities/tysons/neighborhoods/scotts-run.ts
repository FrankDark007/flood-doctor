        "Scotts Run occupies Tysons' western edge near McLean, representing a transitional area between Tysons' dense urban core and McLean's more suburban character. This neighborhood includes established office buildings, commercial properties, and residential developments that predate the recent Tysons transformation. Properties here often feature aging infrastructure, original mechanical systems, and construction methods from earlier decades.",
        "Water damage restoration in Scotts Run frequently involves challenges associated with older buildings—aging plumbing systems, original roofing approaching replacement, HVAC equipment beyond typical service life, and building envelopes requiring maintenance. These properties may lack the sophisticated monitoring systems common in newer Tysons buildings, meaning water damage can progress further before discovery.",
        "Our restoration services throughout Scotts Run reflect understanding of established building challenges—experience with aging systems, realistic assessment of infrastructure conditions, and coordination with property owners considering whether restoration represents an opportunity for broader building improvements alongside water damage repairs."
