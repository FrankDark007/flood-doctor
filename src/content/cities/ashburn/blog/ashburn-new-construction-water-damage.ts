    introduction: `Ashburn's explosive growth has made it one of the fastest-growing communities in Virginia. New neighborhoods appear regularly, and thousands of families have moved into homes built within the past decade. While new construction offers modern features and fresh materials, it's not immune to water damage—and certain risks are actually higher in new construction due to installation errors, settling, and the pace of rapid development.

This guide helps Ashburn new construction owners understand and address water damage risks.`,

        heading: "Why New Construction Has Water Risks",
        content: `New homes face specific water damage vulnerabilities:

**Construction pace:**
Ashburn's development boom means builders operate at high volume:
- Rushed timelines can mean overlooked details
- Subcontractor quality varies
- Inspections happen quickly
- Some issues aren't visible until occupancy

**Settling effects:**
New construction settles during the first years:
- Foundation movement opens cracks
- Plumbing connections stress and may separate
- Window and door frames shift
- Grading changes as soil compacts

**Inexperienced systems:**
New systems haven't been tested by time:
- First heavy rain reveals roof and drainage issues
- First cold snap exposes insulation gaps
- First extended use stresses plumbing
- First summer reveals HVAC drainage problems

**New material issues:**
Even new materials can have problems:
- Defective components from manufacturing
- Improper installation of correct materials
- Incompatible materials that degrade quickly
- Warranty-period failures are common

**Landscaping and grading:**
Initial landscaping often needs adjustment:
- Grading may not be optimal
- Drainage patterns not established
- Downspout discharge may need extension
- Soil compaction changes water flow`

        heading: "Common New Construction Water Problems",
        content: `Specific water damage patterns appear frequently in new construction:

**Window and door leaks:**
Modern windows and doors are complex assemblies:
- Improper flashing installation
- Missing or inadequate sealant
- Weep holes blocked or missing
- Issues may not appear until first heavy rain

*Signs:* Water staining around frames, drywall damage near windows

**Plumbing connection failures:**
New plumbing fails at connection points:
- Supply lines not properly tightened
- Drain connections with inadequate slope
- Push-fit fittings that release
- Solder joint failures in copper systems

*Signs:* Water under sinks, moisture in walls, unexplained stains

**HVAC condensate problems:**
High-efficiency systems produce significant condensation:
- Drain pans not level
- Condensate lines improperly routed
- Missing or disconnected drains
- Debris from construction clogs lines

*Signs:* Water near air handlers, ceiling stains, musty odors

**Grading and drainage issues:**
New lots often have grading problems:
- Soil settles after construction
- Grading may direct water toward foundation
- Downspout discharge too close to foundation
- Sump systems may not be adequate

*Signs:* Basement moisture, water pooling near foundation, damp smells

**Roofing defects:**
Even new roofs can have issues:
- Improper flashing installation
- Nailing errors
- Vent penetration problems
- Valley installation defects

*Signs:* Attic moisture, ceiling stains, water after rain`
