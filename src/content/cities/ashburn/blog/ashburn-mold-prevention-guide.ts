        heading: "Why Mold Thrives in Ashburn's Climate",
        content: `Northern Virginia's environment favors mold:

**Humidity levels:**
- Summer humidity regularly exceeds 70%
- Extended humid periods from May through September
- Even air-conditioned homes can have high humidity
- Humidity persists indoors without active management

**Temperature:**
- Moderate temperatures year-round support mold
- Rarely cold enough to inhibit growth
- Spring and fall are particularly risky
- Basements stay in ideal temperature range

**Precipitation:**
- 40+ inches annual rainfall
- Wet springs with extended rain
- Summer thunderstorms
- Fall hurricane remnants

**Building factors:**
- Many homes have basements (high-risk areas)
- HVAC systems can spread spores
- Newer tight construction may trap moisture
- Established homes may have hidden issues`

**Target levels:**
- Keep indoor humidity between 30-50%
- Never exceed 60% for extended periods
- Monitor with hygrometers in problem areas
- Basements need particular attention

**Dehumidification strategies:**

- Empty regularly or connect to drain
- Run continuously during humid months

*Whole-house dehumidifiers:*
- Integrate with HVAC system
- More effective and efficient
- Automatic humidity control
- Higher upfront cost

**Ventilation:**
- Use exhaust fans during and after showers
- Run fans 20+ minutes after bathing
- Vent dryers to outside
- Use range hood when cooking
- Verify exhausts vent outside, not to attic`

        heading: "After Water Damage: Critical Prevention",
        content: `Water damage is the primary trigger for mold:

**The 24-48 hour window:**
Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of water exposure. Quick, proper drying prevents growth.

**Professional drying matters:**
- Industrial equipment dries faster
- Moisture meters verify complete drying
- Hidden moisture is detected and addressed
- "Feels dry" isn't the same as being dry

**Steps after water events:**
1. Remove standing water immediately
2. Call for professional help for significant water
3. Don't rely on household fans alone
4. Verify drying with moisture measurements
5. Monitor for mold in following weeks

**Warning signs after water damage:**
- Musty odor developing
- Visible growth appearing
- Discoloration of materials
- Health symptoms in occupants

**If mold appears:**
- Don't disturb it (spreads spores)
- Identify and address moisture source
- Small areas may be DIY-cleanable
- Larger areas need professional remediation
- Call (703) 656-0103 for assessment`
