        heading: "Common Claim Mistakes",
        content: `Avoid these errors that lead to denials:

**Delayed reporting:**
Most policies require prompt notification. Delays raise questions and can void coverage.

**Inadequate documentation:**
Without photos before cleanup, it's your word against the adjuster's assessment.

**Throwing away evidence:**
Insurance may want to inspect damaged items. Keep them until claim is settled.

**Admitting fault:**
Don't speculate about causes or admit negligence. Stick to facts.

**Failing to mitigate:**
You must prevent further damage. Failure to do so may limit coverage.

**Unauthorized permanent repairs:**
Emergency mitigation is fine, but wait for adjuster before permanent repairs.

**Accepting first offer:**
Initial settlements are negotiable. If inadequate, provide documentation and negotiate.

**DIY for significant damage:**
Professional restoration provides documentation and thoroughness that supports claims.

**Not reading your policy:**
Knowing your coverage helps you understand what to expect and argue for.`
