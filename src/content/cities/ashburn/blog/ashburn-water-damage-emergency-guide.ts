    introduction: `Ashburn has experienced explosive growth over the past two decades, with communities ranging from established neighborhoods to brand-new construction. Whether you live in Ashburn Village, Brambleton, One Loudoun, or any of Ashburn's many developments, water damage can strike without warning—from burst pipes, appliance failures, storm events, or plumbing problems.

When water floods your Ashburn home, your response in the first minutes determines whether you face a manageable repair or a major restoration project.`,

        content: `**Safety is the first priority.**
- Ensure everyone is accounted for
- Keep children and pets away from water
- Don't enter water if you suspect electrical hazard

**Stop the water source:**

*If you can identify the source:*
- Under-sink leak: Close the hot and cold valves under the sink
- Toilet overflow: Close the valve behind the toilet
- Washing machine: Close supply valves behind the machine
- Water heater: Close the cold water inlet valve
- Appliance failure: Locate the appliance supply valve

*If you can't identify the source or stop it:*
Turn off your main water shutoff. In Ashburn homes:
- Single-family homes: typically in basement or crawlspace where water line enters
- Townhomes: often in utility closet or near water heater
- Newer construction: may have labeled shutoff in utility area

**Know your shutoff location now.** Find it today, before you need it.

**Electrical safety:**
- If water is near electrical outlets, panels, or appliances, turn off power at the breaker
- Never enter standing water when electricity may be present
- If your breaker panel is in water, stay away and call an electrician`

        heading: "Ashburn-Specific Considerations",
        content: `Ashburn's housing characteristics create specific water damage patterns:

**Newer construction (post-2000):**
Much of Ashburn was built in the past 20 years:
- Modern materials dry differently than older construction
- Builder warranties may apply for recent construction
- Plastic and PEX plumbing reduces some failure types
- But rapid construction pace means quality varies

**HOA communities:**
Most Ashburn neighborhoods have HOAs:
- May require specific contractors or processes
- Exterior water issues may involve HOA
- Report damage promptly per your CC&Rs
- Know your association's emergency contacts

**Basement prevalence:**
Many Ashburn homes have basements:
- Popular for finished living space
- At risk during heavy rain events
- Sump pump failures cause significant damage
- Below-grade moisture creates ongoing challenges

**Townhome communities:**
Ashburn has many townhome developments:
- Multi-level construction spreads water damage
- Shared walls may mean neighbor involvement
- HOA coordination often required
- Multiple insurance policies may apply

**Data center corridor:**
Ashburn's tech industry means many homeowners travel:
- Extended absences increase damage from undetected water
- Smart home monitoring can help
- Know your options for emergency access`

        heading: "Common Ashburn Water Damage Causes",
        content: `Understanding common causes helps with prevention:

**Supply line failures:**
Flexible supply lines under sinks and toilets are the most common failure point:
- Deteriorate with age
- Can release water for hours before discovery
- Replace every 5-7 years with braided stainless steel

**Washing machine hose failures:**
In-unit laundry is standard in Ashburn homes:
- Rubber hoses deteriorate and burst
- Use braided stainless steel hoses
- Turn off supply when not in use

**Sump pump failures:**
Properties with basements rely on sump pumps:
- Battery backup is essential
- Power outages during storms disable pumps
- Test monthly and maintain regularly

**HVAC condensate issues:**
Modern HVAC systems produce significant condensation:
- Clogged lines cause overflow
- Often in attic or utility areas
- Damage spreads before discovery

**Storm-related flooding:**
Ashburn's soil and rapid development affect drainage:
- Heavy rain can overwhelm drainage systems
- New development changes water flow patterns
- Basement flooding common during major storms

**New construction defects:**
Rapid construction pace can mean:
- Improperly installed plumbing
- Missing waterproofing
- Grading issues discovered after occupancy`
