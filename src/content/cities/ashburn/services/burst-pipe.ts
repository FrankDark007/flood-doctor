    headline: "Emergency Burst Pipe Response for Ashburn Homes",
    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe releases 400-600 gallons of water per hour into your Ashburn home. Within the time it takes to drive home from Tysons or Reston, a failed supply line can flood your entire finished basement. The home office where you work remotely, the media room where your family gathers, the playroom your children love—all underwater because of a quarter-inch crack in a supply line.

Flood Doctor has responded to burst pipe emergencies throughout Ashburn since this community's earliest developments. We've extracted water from Broadlands townhomes at 3 AM, dried the finished basements of Brambleton single-families after supply line failures, and restored Lansdowne properties following winter freeze damage. When pipe failures strike Ashburn—and they strike every winter—our crews are positioned within minutes of your door.`,

      `Ashburn's burst pipe patterns follow predictable timelines. Builder-grade supply lines—the cheap rubber hoses connected to washing machines, refrigerators, and dishwashers—fail earlier than quality materials, often within 5-10 years of installation. Winter freezes catch exterior hose bibs and poorly insulated attic lines. Older PVC fittings in HVAC systems crack during temperature swings.

We coordinate water shutoff, extract standing water, and begin drying before a plumber even arrives. Time matters: every hour of delay means thousands more in damage to your Ashburn home.`

    localContext: "Ashburn's newer construction often features builder-grade plumbing components that fail earlier than quality materials. Understanding these common failure points helps homeowners prevent disasters and recognize when supply lines need proactive replacement."

    {
      question: "What should I do first when a pipe bursts in my Ashburn home?",
      answer: "Shut off the main water supply immediately—this stops water flow while you call for help. If you can't find the shutoff or it's stuck, call us at (703) 656-0109 anyway—we can guide you and are dispatching simultaneously. Turn off electricity to affected areas if water is near outlets or panels."
    },
    {
      question: "How much water damage can a burst pipe cause?",
      answer: "A typical supply line releases 400-600 gallons per hour. In the time it takes to commute home from work, a burst pipe can release 2,000+ gallons into your Ashburn home. Water then migrates through open floor plans, down through floors, and into areas far from the original break. Fast shutoff and immediate response are critical."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do supply lines fail in newer Ashburn homes?",
      answer: "Builder-grade supply lines are cheaper than quality materials. The rubber hoses installed during Ashburn's construction boom often fail within 5-10 years—exactly when homes are reaching that age now. Proactive replacement with braided stainless steel prevents these failures."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call a plumber or water damage company first?",
      answer: "Call us first—we respond faster, can begin extraction while the plumber repairs, and coordinate the entire process. We have relationships with Loudoun County plumbers and can recommend reliable emergency plumbing if needed. Our goal is getting water out before it spreads further."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover burst pipe damage?",
      answer: "Yes, most homeowner policies cover sudden pipe failures and resulting water damage. Gradual leaks from maintenance neglect may have limitations. We document everything for your claim, photograph damage, log moisture readings, and provide the detailed reports adjusters need."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you prevent mold after a burst pipe?",
      answer: "With fast response and proper drying, yes. Mold needs 24-48 hours of moisture to begin growing. We extract water immediately, deploy industrial drying equipment, and monitor moisture levels until materials return to normal. Our thorough approach prevents the mold problems that follow inadequate restoration."
