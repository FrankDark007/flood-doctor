    headline: "Professional Flood Cleanup for Ashburn Homes",
    paragraphs: [
      `Summer storms roll through Loudoun County with little warning. One moment your Broadlands home is peaceful; an hour later, eight inches of rain has overwhelmed storm drains, flooded window wells, and sent muddy water cascading into your finished basement. Your home office, media room, and children's playroom—spaces you've invested years perfecting—now sit under brown water.

Flood Doctor has cleaned up after every major storm event in Ashburn since this community's earliest neighborhoods emerged. We've pumped out Brambleton basements after flash floods, extracted storm water from Lansdowne single-families, and restored One Loudoun properties after summer deluges. When NOAA issues a flash flood warning for Loudoun County, our phones light up with Ashburn addresses—and our trucks are already positioned to respond.`,

      `Flood cleanup differs from typical water damage. Storm water carries soil, debris, and contaminants that complicate restoration. Ashburn's clay-laden runoff deposits sediment in carpet fibers, flooring grain, and HVAC systems. Flash floods overwhelm sump pumps, breach foundation walls, and create contamination categories that require specialized protocols.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand Ashburn's flood patterns: the low-lying areas in developing neighborhoods, the overwhelmed storm drains along Loudoun County Parkway, and the grading issues in rapidly-built subdivisions. We don't just pump and leave—we extract, decontaminate, and restore.`
    ],
    localContext: "Ashburn's newer developments sometimes feature grading that didn't anticipate actual storm intensity. Low-lying lots, inadequate storm drainage, and settling soil create flood vulnerabilities that weren't apparent when homes were built."

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "Should I wait until the storm passes to call for flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Call immediately, even during the storm. We dispatch when it's safe to travel—often before rain fully stops. Earlier calls mean earlier response times. Standing flood water continues damaging your Ashburn home every hour it remains. Our crews know Loudoun County's roads and can reach your neighborhood as soon as conditions allow."
    },
    {
      question: "Is flood water from a storm contaminated?",
      answer: "Almost always yes. Storm water picks up soil bacteria, lawn chemicals, fertilizers, and debris as it flows. If it mixed with sewage backup—possible during heavy storms—it's Category 3 biohazard. We assess contamination level and apply appropriate protocols. Don't wade through flood water without protection."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flood damage from a storm?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance typically covers storm damage, including water intrusion from overwhelmed drainage, window well flooding, and sump pump failure. Separate flood insurance is needed for rising water events. We document everything for your claim and work directly with adjusters."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take in an Ashburn home?",
      answer: "Initial water extraction takes hours; complete drying takes 5-10 days depending on affected area and materials. Ashburn's finished basements with modern materials require careful, monitored drying. Rushing creates mold problems later. We provide daily updates and realistic timelines."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my furniture and belongings be saved after flooding?",
      answer: "Many items can be cleaned and restored. We assess each item, separate salvageable from unsalvageable, and provide content cleaning services. Porous materials that absorbed contaminated water—like upholstered furniture in Category 3 flooding—typically require disposal for health reasons."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my newer home flood when older homes don't?",
      answer: "Ashburn's rapid development sometimes meant grading that didn't account for actual storm conditions. Soil settling changes water flow patterns over time. Storm drainage designed for theoretical rainfall gets overwhelmed by actual storms. These issues affect newer developments regardless of construction quality."
