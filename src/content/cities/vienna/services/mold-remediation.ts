    paragraphs: [
      `Mold in your Vienna home isn't just an aesthetic problem—it's a health concern that demands professional remediation. Whether you've discovered visible growth in your Oakton basement, smell musty odors in your Church Street colonial's crawl space, or found hidden mold during a Wolf Trap home renovation, the response must be thorough, safe, and effective.

Flood Doctor's IICRC-certified mold remediation teams have addressed mold problems throughout Vienna for nearly two decades. We've remediated basement mold in Dunn Loring homes, eliminated crawl space contamination in Vienna Woods properties, and removed mold from historic downtown Vienna houses—always following industry protocols that protect your family and prevent recurrence. This isn't a DIY problem, and we don't treat it like one.`,

      `Vienna's environment creates perfect conditions for mold growth. The town's humid summers combine with basement moisture from high groundwater—especially in neighborhoods near Difficult Run—to create damp conditions mold thrives in. Older homes along Church Street and in established neighborhoods often have crawl spaces with decades of moisture accumulation. Even newer Wolf Trap construction can develop mold when HVAC systems, bath ventilation, or basement waterproofing underperform.

Our approach addresses both visible mold and the conditions enabling growth. Removing mold without addressing the moisture source is temporary at best. We identify water intrusion points, remediate existing contamination, and help you understand what changes will prevent recurrence. Vienna homeowners deserve lasting solutions, not repeated service calls.`
    ],
    localContext: "Vienna's humid climate, high groundwater near Difficult Run, and mix of housing ages create varied mold challenges. From historic home crawl spaces to modern basement finishing, we provide IICRC-certified remediation that addresses both contamination and underlying moisture sources."

This moisture migrates through foundation walls and floor slabs, creating ideal conditions for mold growth in finished and unfinished basements alike.",

    {
      question: "How do I know if I have mold in my Vienna home?",
      answer: "Common signs include visible growth (often appearing as dark spots or discoloration), musty odors, unexplained allergic symptoms, or previous water damage that wasn't professionally dried. Many mold problems are hidden behind walls or in crawl spaces—if you suspect mold, a professional inspection with thermal imaging can reveal hidden growth."
    },
    {
      question: "Is mold dangerous?",
      answer: "Yes. Mold exposure can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and other health effects—particularly for children, elderly individuals, and those with existing respiratory conditions. Black mold (Stachybotrys) receives the most attention, but all mold types should be professionally addressed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I remove mold myself?",
      answer: "Small surface mold (less than 10 square feet) on non-porous surfaces can sometimes be addressed with proper precautions. Larger areas, hidden mold, mold in HVAC systems, or mold following water damage requires professional remediation. DIY attempts often spread contamination and fail to address underlying moisture."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does mold remediation take?",
      answer: "Typical Vienna mold remediation takes 3-5 days depending on scope. This includes containment setup, removal, treatment, cleaning, and verification. Larger projects may take longer. We don't rush—proper protocols protect your family and ensure lasting results."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover mold remediation?",
      answer: "It depends. Mold resulting from covered water damage (burst pipes, appliance failures) is often covered. Pre-existing mold, maintenance-related moisture, or flood damage may not be covered by standard policies. We can help you understand your coverage and document appropriately for claims."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold come back after remediation?",
      answer: "Not if the moisture source is addressed. Mold requires moisture to grow—remove the moisture and mold can't return. Our remediation process identifies moisture sources and provides recommendations for correction. Addressing these recommendations is essential for lasting results."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you verify the mold is gone?",
      answer: "Post-remediation verification includes visual inspection, moisture measurement to confirm dry conditions, and air quality testing comparing spore counts to outdoor baseline levels. Vienna homeowners receive documentation confirming successful remediation."
