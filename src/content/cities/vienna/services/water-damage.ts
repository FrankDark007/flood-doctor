        question: 'Can you restore older Vienna colonials with plaster walls?',
        answer: 'Absolutely. We\'ve restored hundreds of Vienna\'s 1950s-70s colonials and specialize in historic home water damage. Our craftsmen understand plaster wall construction, use appropriate drying techniques preventing cracking, and perform traditional plaster repairs matching your home\'s original character. We also have expertise with the hardwood floors, vintage trim, and period details common in Vienna\'s older homes.'

      },
      {
        question: 'What causes basement flooding in Vienna homes?',
        answer: 'Vienna basement flooding typically results from foundation seepage in older colonials (hydrostatic pressure during heavy rain), sump pump failures, inadequate drainage systems, or storm-related events near Difficult Run and Wolf Trap Creek. We extract water immediately, perform complete structural drying, and provide recommendations addressing the underlying cause to prevent recurrence.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will you work with my insurance company?',
        answer: 'Yes, insurance coordination is a core service. We document damage thoroughly with photos and moisture readings, provide detailed estimates matching insurance requirements, communicate directly with adjusters, and bill approved claims directly when possible. Our experience with Vienna-area insurance providers and local adjusters helps ensure fair settlements for restoration costs.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does water damage restoration take?',
        answer: 'Timeline depends on damage extent. Minor water damage may take 3-5 days for drying and restoration. Significant damage to Vienna colonials with plaster walls or extensive basement flooding may require 2-3 weeks for complete restoration including reconstruction. We provide accurate timelines after initial assessment and keep you informed as work progresses.'

      {
        question: 'Can you handle townhome water damage requiring HOA coordination?',

        question: 'Do you restore water-damaged hardwood floors?',
        answer: 'Yes, hardwood floor restoration is a specialty. Vienna homes often have beautiful original oak floors or modern engineered hardwood that require specialized drying techniques. We assess moisture content, use hardwood drying mats when appropriate, and determine whether floors can be saved through refinishing or require replacement. Our goal is preserving original floors whenever possible.'

      {
        question: 'What should I do immediately after discovering water damage?',
        answer: 'First ensure family safety and shut off the water source if possible. Then call us immediately at (703) 656-0105—faster response significantly reduces damage. Move valuables to dry areas if safe to do so, but avoid walking through standing water. Don\'t use household vacuums on water. Our emergency team will guide you through immediate steps while dispatching to your Vienna location.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you provide mold remediation after water damage?',
        answer: 'Yes, mold remediation is included when needed. Vienna\'s older homes often have ventilation issues making them susceptible to mold growth after water damage. We provide EPA-approved mold remediation, address underlying moisture sources, and implement prevention strategies. All water damage restoration includes antimicrobial treatment preventing future mold development.'
