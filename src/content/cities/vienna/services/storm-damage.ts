  introSection: {
    headline: "Vienna's Storm Damage Emergency Response",
    paragraphs: [
      `Northern Virginia's severe weather doesn't announce itself—and when storms strike Vienna, the damage can be immediate and extensive. Summer thunderstorms bring damaging winds that topple the mature oaks and maples Vienna is known for, sending them through roofs, across power lines, and onto homes. Winter ice storms coat tree limbs until they snap, crashing onto properties throughout Wolf Trap, Oakton, and Vienna Woods. When storm damage opens your home to the elements, immediate response prevents catastrophic secondary damage.

Flood Doctor responds to Vienna storm emergencies around the clock—because storms don't follow business hours. We've tarped damaged roofs in Dunn Loring during ongoing thunderstorms, extracted rainwater from Church Street attics before it could reach living spaces below, and dried water-soaked homes throughout Hunter Mill after nor'easters breached building envelopes. When a storm threatens your Vienna property, we're already mobilizing.`,

      `Storm damage creates unique restoration challenges. Unlike plumbing failures or basement flooding, storm damage often involves structural breaches—holes in roofs, broken windows, and compromised walls that continue allowing water intrusion until secured. The damage may be obvious (a tree through your Wolf Trap sunroom) or hidden (wind-lifted shingles that allow water entry you won't discover for days). And storm damage rarely affects one home alone—area-wide events strain restoration resources just when you need them most.

Our storm response approach prioritizes stopping additional damage before beginning restoration. Emergency tarping, board-up, and water extraction happen immediately—even during the storm if conditions allow. Only after your Vienna home is secured do we assess full damage extent, document for insurance, and begin the restoration process. This prevents the scenario too many homeowners face: waiting days for help while rain continues pouring through storm damage.`
    ],
    localContext: "Vienna's tree-lined streets and mature neighborhoods create storm vulnerabilities throughout the town. From the established canopies of Church Street to the wooded lots of Wolf Trap, falling trees and wind damage are consistent risks during Northern Virginia's severe weather seasons."

        title: "Mature Tree Damage",
        description: "Vienna's neighborhoods feature mature oaks, maples, and other large trees that create storm vulnerabilities. High winds topple weakened trees onto homes, and even healthy trees can lose major limbs during ice storms. Church Street, Wolf Trap, and Vienna's established neighborhoods are particularly susceptible.",
        solution: "We respond to tree damage emergencies with tarping and water extraction—even before tree removal. Once the tree is removed (we can recommend arborists), we assess and dry all affected areas. Many tree-strike situations involve hidden damage beyond the obvious impact point."

        title: "Wind-Driven Rain Through Roof Damage",
        description: "Summer thunderstorms and winter nor'easters bring high winds that can lift shingles, damage flashing, and create roof breaches. Water entry may begin subtly—you might not notice damage until water appears on ceilings or walls below.",
        solution: "Emergency tarping stops water intrusion while roofing contractors schedule repairs. Our thermal imaging identifies all moisture penetration, including water that's traveled from the original entry point. We dry completely before any repairs are made."

When flooding results from overwhelmed municipal systems or unusual groundwater, we document the circumstances for insurance. Some storm-related flooding may be covered differently than standard water damage."

        solution: "We're prepared for area-wide events with multiple crews and scalable response. We prioritize by damage severity—active water intrusion gets fastest response. Even during major events, we aim for same-day stabilization of all affected Vienna properties we can reach."

      question: "How quickly can you respond during a storm?",
      answer: "We dispatch immediately when you call (703) 656-0105—even during ongoing storms. Response time depends on storm severity and area-wide damage extent. For active water intrusion, we aim for 30-60 minute response even during major events. We prioritize by damage severity to reach the most urgent situations first."

    {
      question: "Can you work while it's still raining?",
      answer: "Yes. Emergency tarping and board-up can proceed during rain if conditions are safe for crew access. Stopping additional water intrusion is the priority—we don't wait for weather to clear while rain pours through your damaged roof. Interior water extraction also proceeds immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "A tree fell on my house—do you remove trees?",
      answer: "We focus on water damage response—tarping, extraction, and drying. For tree removal, we recommend arborists and tree services we've worked with on Vienna properties. However, we can tarp and extract water immediately without waiting for tree removal, preventing additional damage during the wait."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover storm damage?",
      answer: "Most storm damage—including wind, fallen trees, and water damage from roof breaches—is covered by standard homeowners insurance. Flood damage from rising water may require separate flood insurance. We handle insurance documentation and direct billing for all storm-related claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you find all the water damage from a roof leak?",
      answer: "Thermal imaging cameras detect temperature differences caused by moisture, revealing water damage behind walls and in ceilings without destructive investigation. Storm water often travels from entry points—appearing in walls and ceilings far from the obvious damage. We trace these patterns to ensure complete drying."
    },
    {
      question: "My power is out and my sump pump stopped—do you help with that?",
      answer: "Yes. Power outage-related flooding is covered under our storm damage response. We extract water, set up generators to power drying equipment, and restore your basement. We also document the power outage cause for insurance claims."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does storm damage restoration take?",
      answer: "It depends on damage extent. Emergency stabilization and water extraction happen within hours. Drying typically takes 4-7 days. Full restoration—including roof repair, interior rebuild, and finish work—may take weeks depending on contractor availability and damage scope. We coordinate the entire process."
