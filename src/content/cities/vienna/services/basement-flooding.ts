    description: 'Common questions about basement water damage in Vienna homes.',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Why do Vienna basements flood so frequently?',
        answer: 'Vienna\'s many 1950s-70s colonials were built when foundation waterproofing standards differed from today. Aging foundations, deteriorated waterproofing, inadequate drainage systems, and hydrostatic pressure during heavy rain combine to create basement flooding. Properties near Difficult Run and Wolf Trap Creek face additional flash flood risks. The good news: most basement flooding is preventable with proper drainage and waterproofing improvements.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How quickly can you remove water from my flooded basement?',
        answer: 'We typically arrive within 45 minutes throughout Vienna and begin extraction immediately. Most Vienna basements can be completely extracted in 2-6 hours depending on water depth and basement size. Our truck-mounted extraction systems remove water rapidly—the faster we extract, the less damage your basement sustains and the shorter overall restoration time.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will my finished basement need to be completely gutted?',
        answer: 'Not always. If we arrive quickly and water hasn\'t saturated materials for extended periods, we may save drywall, flooring, and finishes through aggressive extraction and drying. However, basement flooding often requires "flood cuts"—removing drywall 12-24 inches above water lines—to dry wall cavities and prevent mold. We assess each situation individually and save materials whenever possible while ensuring complete drying.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What causes sump pumps to fail during storms?',
        answer: 'The most common cause is power outages disabling pumps precisely when needed most. Other failures include burned-out motors, float switch malfunctions, frozen discharge lines in winter, and pumps undersized for water volume. We recommend battery backup systems, proper pump maintenance, and testing pumps before storm season. After pump failure flooding, we assess your system and provide upgrade recommendations.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you prevent mold after basement flooding?',
        answer: 'Mold prevention requires complete structural drying (moisture levels below 15% in all materials), antimicrobial treatment of affected surfaces, and proper humidity control. Vienna basements are especially susceptible to mold due to naturally higher humidity. We use commercial dehumidifiers, monitor moisture daily, and treat all surfaces with EPA-approved antimicrobial products. Complete drying before reconstruction is essential—rushed restoration often leads to mold problems months later.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you fix the underlying cause of my basement flooding?',
        answer: 'We focus on restoration and emergency water removal, but we coordinate with waterproofing specialists for permanent solutions. After extracting water and completing restoration, we assess your specific flooding cause—foundation seepage, inadequate drainage, sump pump issues—and provide referrals to trusted contractors offering interior drainage systems, exterior waterproofing, or other solutions. We can perform restoration work after waterproofing installation if needed.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will insurance cover basement flooding restoration?',
        answer: 'Coverage depends on the water source. Sudden internal events (burst pipes, hot water heater failures, sump pump malfunctions) are typically covered. Foundation seepage may have limited coverage. Surface water flooding usually requires separate flood insurance. We document everything thoroughly, work directly with insurance companies, and help maximize coverage regardless of the flooding source. Call us immediately after flooding—we\'ll guide you through insurance notification while dispatching to your location.'

        question: 'How long will basement flooding restoration take?',
        answer: 'Timeline depends on damage extent. Minor flooding with quick response may take 4-6 days (3-5 days drying, 1-2 days restoration). Significant finished basement flooding requiring extensive material removal and reconstruction may take 2-3 weeks. We provide accurate timelines after initial assessment and keep you informed throughout the process. Proper drying cannot be rushed—complete moisture removal is essential for successful restoration.'

        question: 'What should I do while waiting for your emergency team?',
        answer: 'First ensure family safety—avoid walking through deep standing water. Shut off electricity to the basement if you can do so safely. Move valuable items to higher ground if possible. Don\'t use household vacuums on water (electrical hazard). Document damage with photos for insurance if safe to do so. Our emergency team will guide you through additional steps while traveling to your Vienna location—call (703) 656-0105 immediately.'
