    heading: 'Vienna Burst Pipe FAQs',
    description: 'Common questions about pipe burst restoration in Vienna.',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How quickly can you respond to a burst pipe emergency in Vienna?',
        answer: 'Our average response time throughout Vienna is 45 minutes. We maintain 24/7 emergency teams ready to dispatch immediately when pipes burst. Call (703) 656-0105 for immediate help—we\'ll guide you through shutting off water while technicians travel to your location. Faster response means less water damage and lower restoration costs.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Should I shut off the water before calling you?',
        answer: 'Yes, absolutely shut off water immediately if possible. Locate your main shutoff valve (usually near the water meter or where the main line enters) and turn it clockwise to close. If you can\'t find the main shutoff or it won\'t turn, shut off the water heater and call us immediately—we\'ll guide you through additional steps while dispatching emergency teams to your Vienna home.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you protect my hardwood floors during burst pipe restoration?',
        answer: 'Yes, hardwood floor protection is a priority throughout Vienna restoration. We extract water immediately using specialized equipment preventing prolonged saturation, use hardwood-specific drying mats when needed, and monitor moisture content preventing cupping and warping. Vienna\'s many homes with original oak floors require this expertise—we\'ve saved countless hardwood floors through rapid response and proper drying techniques.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will burst pipes damage my plaster walls?',
        answer: 'Burst pipes behind plaster walls certainly create damage risks, but we use specialized techniques minimizing harm. Gentle drying prevents cracking, we carefully remove water from wall cavities, and use traditional plaster repair methods when access is necessary. Our goal is preserving Vienna\'s historic plaster walls whenever possible while ensuring complete drying prevents hidden mold growth.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you coordinate with plumbers for pipe repairs?',
        answer: 'Yes, we work closely with licensed plumbers throughout restoration. While we focus on water damage restoration, we coordinate plumber access for pipe repairs, adjust our schedule around plumbing work, and often recommend trusted Vienna-area plumbers when homeowners need referrals. Complete pipe repair is essential before we seal walls and complete restoration.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you prevent mold after a pipe burst?',
        answer: 'Mold prevention requires rapid water extraction, complete structural drying (including hidden wall cavities), and antimicrobial treatment. We use thermal imaging finding hidden moisture, monitor drying progress daily with moisture meters, and don\'t begin reconstruction until materials reach proper moisture levels. Vienna\'s older homes are especially susceptible to mold—proper drying cannot be rushed regardless of timeline pressure.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will insurance cover burst pipe restoration?',
        answer: 'Most Vienna homeowners policies cover sudden and accidental pipe bursts including water damage restoration costs. We document everything thoroughly with photos and moisture readings, provide detailed estimates, and work directly with insurance companies maximizing coverage. Gradual leaks may have limited coverage, but catastrophic bursts are typically fully covered. We help navigate insurance claims throughout the restoration process.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if the pipe burst affected multiple floors?',
        answer: 'Multi-floor water damage is common when pipes burst upstairs. Water travels through floor penetrations, wall cavities, and ceiling fixtures, affecting rooms below. We extract water from all floors, perform complete vertical drying, and restore every affected area. Our Vienna teams have extensive experience with multi-story water damage in colonials—we ensure thorough restoration throughout your home.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long will burst pipe restoration take?',
        answer: 'Timeline depends on damage extent. Minor pipe bursts affecting single rooms may take 4-6 days (3-4 days drying, 1-2 days restoration). Significant bursts affecting multiple floors with plaster wall damage may require 2-3 weeks for complete restoration. We provide accurate timelines after initial assessment and keep you informed as work progresses.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you prevent future pipe bursts in my Vienna home?',
        answer: 'While we focus on restoration, we provide recommendations preventing future bursts: pipe insulation for freeze protection, galvanized plumbing replacement suggestions, supply line upgrade recommendations, water heater preventive maintenance, and shutoff valve improvements. We often refer homeowners to trusted plumbers for preventive upgrades after experiencing burst pipe damage.'
