      },

        question: 'Do you have experience with Vienna\'s older colonial homes?',
        answer: 'Absolutely. We\'ve restored hundreds of Vienna\'s 1950s-70s colonials and understand their specific challenges—plaster walls, hardwood floors, basement seepage issues, and aging infrastructure. Our technicians use restoration techniques that preserve the character of historic Vienna homes while providing modern water damage solutions.'
      },

        answer: 'First, ensure family safety and shut off the water source if possible. Then call us immediately at (703) 656-0105—faster response reduces damage significantly. Move valuables to dry areas if safe to do so, but avoid walking through standing water. Don\'t use household vacuums on water. Our emergency team will guide you through immediate steps while we dispatch to your Vienna location.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will my homeowners insurance cover water damage restoration?',
        answer: 'Most Vienna homeowners insurance policies cover sudden and accidental water damage like burst pipes, hot water heater failures, and storm damage. Coverage varies for flood damage (typically requires separate flood insurance) and gradual damage. We document everything thoroughly and work directly with your insurance company to maximize your coverage.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does water damage restoration take in Vienna homes?',
        answer: 'Timeline depends on damage extent. Minor incidents may take 3-5 days for drying and restoration. Significant damage to Vienna colonials with plaster walls or extensive basement flooding may require 2-3 weeks for complete restoration. We provide accurate timelines after initial assessment and keep you informed throughout the process.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you handle basement flooding common in Vienna neighborhoods?',

Our solutions include water extraction, structural drying, mold prevention, and recommendations for preventing future basement water problems.'
