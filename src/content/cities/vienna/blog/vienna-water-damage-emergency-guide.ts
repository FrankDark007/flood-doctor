    introduction: `Vienna's established neighborhoods feature homes ranging from mid-century colonials to new construction, each with their own water damage vulnerabilities. Whether you live in the historic downtown area, Windover Heights, or newer developments near Tysons, water damage can strike without warning—from aging pipes, appliance failures, storm events, or plumbing problems.

When water floods your Vienna home, your response in the first minutes determines whether you face a manageable repair or a major restoration project.`,

        content: `**Safety is the first priority.**
- Ensure everyone is accounted for
- Keep children and pets away from water
- Don't enter water if electrical hazard is possible

**Stop the water source:**

*If you can identify the source:*
- Under-sink leak: Close the hot and cold valves
- Toilet overflow: Close the valve behind the toilet
- Washing machine: Close supply valves behind the machine
- Water heater: Close the cold water inlet valve
- Appliance failure: Locate the appliance supply valve

*If you can't identify the source:*
Turn off your main water shutoff. In Vienna homes:
- Older homes: typically in basement where water line enters
- Ranch homes: often near water heater
- Newer construction: may be in utility area or front of house

**Know your shutoff now.** Find it today, before you need it.

**Electrical safety:**
- If water is near electrical outlets or appliances, turn off power at the breaker
- Never enter standing water with electricity present
- If the breaker panel is in water, don't approach—call the utility`

        heading: "Vienna-Specific Considerations",
        content: `Vienna's housing stock creates specific water damage patterns:

**Older homes (1950s-1980s):**
Many Vienna neighborhoods feature established homes:
- Galvanized and copper plumbing approaching end of life
- Original fixtures and connections may be failing
- Basements common, often finished
- Older waterproofing may have degraded

**Historic downtown:**
Vienna's historic core has unique characteristics:
- Some homes date to early 1900s
- Period construction requires careful restoration
- Historic materials need special handling
- Preservation considerations may apply

**Newer construction:**
Recent development near Tysons:
- Modern materials and construction
- May still have settling-related issues
- Builder warranties may apply
- HOA involvement for some properties

**Mature landscaping:**
Vienna's established lots affect drainage:
- Large trees can affect foundation stability
- Root systems alter water flow
- Shade keeps ground damp longer
- Leaves clog gutters and drains

**Small-town infrastructure:**
Vienna's independent water system:
- Know Vienna water emergency contacts
- Some areas served by Fairfax Water
- Pressure variations can stress plumbing`

        heading: "Common Vienna Water Damage Causes",
        content: `Understanding common causes helps with prevention:

**Aging plumbing systems:**
Many Vienna homes have original plumbing:
- Galvanized pipes corrode internally
- Copper develops pinhole leaks
- Original supply lines deteriorate
- Solder joints fail over time

*Prevention:* Professional plumbing inspection, proactive replacement

**Supply line failures:**
Flexible lines under sinks and behind toilets fail:
- Deteriorate with age
- Release water until discovered
- Replace every 5-7 years with braided stainless steel

**Water heater failures:**
Tank heaters fail after 10-15 years:
- Many Vienna homes have aging water heaters
- 40-80 gallon release plus continuous flow
- Replace proactively, install drip pan with alarm

**Basement flooding:**
Common during heavy storms:
- Sump pump failures
- Overwhelmed drainage
- Groundwater intrusion
- Foundation seepage

*Prevention:* Sump pump with battery backup, proper grading

**HVAC condensate issues:**
Clogged lines cause overflow:
- Common in humid seasons
- Damage spreads before discovery
- Annual maintenance prevents most issues`
