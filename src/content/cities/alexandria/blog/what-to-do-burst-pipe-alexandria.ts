    introduction: `A burst pipe can release hundreds of gallons per hour into your Alexandria home. In the moments after discovery, the actions you take determine whether this becomes a manageable repair or a major restoration project.

This guide provides the step-by-step response that protects your home from extensive water damage.`,

        heading: "First 60 Seconds: Stop the Water",
        content: `**Find and close the water source.**

*If you know which fixture failed:*
Turn off the shutoff valve at that fixture:
- Under sinks: Look for small valves on the supply lines
- Behind toilets: Oval valve on the wall or floor
- Washing machine: Hot and cold valves behind the machine
- Water heater: Valve on the cold water line entering the heater

*If you can't identify the source or can't find the fixture shutoff:*
Turn off your main water shutoff. In Alexandria homes, this is typically located:
- In the basement (most common in older homes)
- Near the water heater
- Where the water line enters the house
- In a utility closet
- Near the front of the house, inside

**Know your shutoff before emergencies.**
Find your main shutoff now, before you need it. Test that it works. Make sure everyone in your household knows its location.

*If you can't find or turn the shutoff:*
Call Virginia American Water's emergency line at 800-452-6863 for help locating your shutoff or to have them shut water at the street.`

        heading: "Minutes 1-5: Electrical Safety",
        content: `**Water and electricity are a deadly combination.**

*Assess electrical exposure:*
- Is water near electrical outlets, appliances, or your electrical panel?
- Is water accumulating in areas with electrical connections?
- Are any appliances or electronics in or near the water?

*If water is near electrical systems:*
- Do NOT enter the water
- If you can safely reach your breaker panel without entering water, turn off power to affected areas
- If the panel is in or near water, stay away—call your utility company
- If in doubt, call an electrician or Dominion Energy (866-366-4357) for guidance

*Basic safety:*
- Never use standard household vacuums on standing water
- Unplug electronics that aren't in water before they're reached
- Don't touch electrical devices with wet hands

After shutting off water and ensuring electrical safety, you can focus on damage mitigation.`

        heading: "Minutes 5-15: Damage Mitigation",
        content: `**While waiting for professional help, minimize damage:**

*Move what you can:*
- Lift furniture onto blocks or move to dry areas
- Remove area rugs from wet floors (especially off hardwood)
- Move electronics, documents, and valuables to dry spaces
- Empty lower shelves and cabinets in affected areas
- Relocate items from wet floors

*Slow the spread:*
- Use towels along doorways to create barriers
- Open interior doors to improve air circulation
- If safe, mop up accessible water
- Put containers under active drips

*Document everything:*
- Take photos and video of the water source and spread
- Document water levels and affected areas
- Photograph damaged items before moving them
- Record the time you discovered the problem

*Do NOT:*
- Use fans to "dry" significant water (this can spread moisture into walls)
- Assume it will dry on its own
- Wait to see how bad it gets
- Try to remove wet carpet yourself without proper equipment`

**What we provide:**
- 30-minute response throughout Alexandria
- Industrial extraction that removes water rapidly
- Moisture detection that finds water in walls and under floors
- Professional drying that prevents mold and structural damage
- Documentation for insurance claims

**What to tell us:**
- Your address
- What happened (burst pipe, which fixture if known)
- Whether water is stopped
- Whether there are electrical concerns
- Approximate amount of water/area affected

**While waiting for us:**
Continue mitigation efforts—moving belongings, containing spread, documenting conditions. Every item saved from water contact is damage prevented.`

        heading: "Common Alexandria Pipe Failure Points",
        content: `Understanding why pipes burst helps identify problems earlier:

**Washing machine hoses:**
The most common catastrophic failure. Rubber hoses deteriorate over time, and when they burst, water flows continuously until discovered. Replace rubber hoses with braided stainless steel, and turn off supply valves when not in use.

**Supply lines under sinks:**
Flexible supply lines connecting shutoff valves to faucets fatigue and fail. Replace every 5-7 years, or immediately if you notice corrosion or bulging.

**Water heater connections:**
Both the supply and output connections can fail with age. Inspect connections annually and replace water heaters before they're 12-15 years old.

**Copper pipe corrosion (common in older Alexandria homes):**
Pinhole leaks develop in aging copper from internal corrosion. These often start small and worsen. Blue-green staining on pipes indicates corrosion.

**Frozen pipes (winter risk):**
Pipes in exterior walls, unheated spaces, and crawlspaces can freeze when temperatures drop. Running water during cold snaps and keeping heat at minimum 55°F helps prevent freezing.

**Old galvanized plumbing:**
Pre-1970s Alexandria homes may still have galvanized steel pipes that corrode from the inside. These eventually fail catastrophically—consider proactive replacement if your home still has galvanized supply lines.`

        heading: "Insurance Considerations",
        content: `**Report the claim promptly:**
Contact your homeowner's insurance within 24 hours. Most policies cover sudden pipe bursts, though coverage for gradual damage varies.

**What's typically covered:**
- Water damage from sudden pipe failures
- Structural drying and repair
- Damaged personal property
- Additional living expenses if displacement is required

**What's typically NOT covered:**
- The pipe repair itself (that's maintenance)
- Gradual damage from slow leaks you should have noticed
- Damage from neglected maintenance
- Flood damage from external sources (requires flood insurance)

**Documentation that supports claims:**
- Photos of the water source and damage
- Timeline of discovery and response
- Receipts for emergency mitigation
- Professional restoration reports and invoices
- List of damaged items with values

**We work with insurance:**
Flood Doctor documents everything for insurance claims, works with adjusters, and handles direct billing when applicable. Our documentation supports your claim from initial damage through restoration completion.`

        content: `**Restoration timeline:**

*Day 1:*
- Emergency water extraction
- Moisture assessment throughout the structure
- Drying equipment placement
- Content protection and documentation

*Days 2-5:*
- Active drying with industrial equipment
- Daily monitoring of moisture levels
- Equipment repositioning as needed
- Moisture levels declining toward targets

*Days 5-10:*
- Reaching target moisture levels
- Equipment removal once goals achieved
- Final assessment of affected materials
- Determination of reconstruction needs

*Following weeks (if reconstruction needed):*
- Drywall replacement
- Flooring repair or replacement
- Painting and finishing
- Return to normal

**Living during restoration:**
- Drying equipment is loud—plan accordingly
- Some areas may be inaccessible during drying
- Air quality may require temporary adjustments
- We work to minimize disruption

The exact timeline depends on how much water, how long it ran, and what materials were affected. We provide specific projections after assessment.`
