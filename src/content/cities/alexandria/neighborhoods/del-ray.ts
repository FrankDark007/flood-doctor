  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Del Ray's charm comes from its human scale: tree-lined streets, front porches where neighbors chat, local businesses within walking distance, and the tight community bonds that make this one of Northern Virginia's most desirable neighborhoods. The housing stock—primarily 1920s-1940s bungalows and Cape Cods—represents an era when craftsmanship mattered but plumbing technology hadn't yet evolved to modern standards.

Flood Doctor has protected Del Ray homes for nearly two decades. We've extracted floodwater from crawl spaces after summer storms, dried out finished basements following sewer backups, and restored water-damaged hardwood floors in these charming homes. We understand Del Ray's community values—quick response, careful work, and respect for the neighborhood character that makes this area special.

Del Ray's construction presents unique water damage challenges. Crawl space foundations vulnerable to groundwater infiltration. Original cast iron drain lines reaching end-of-service life. Galvanized supply pipes that corrode from the inside. Small lot sizes that complicate drainage. We've developed restoration approaches specific to Del Ray's building types, protecting these homes while maintaining the architectural character families love.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "Why does my Del Ray crawl space keep flooding?",
      answer: "Del Ray's location and high water table create groundwater challenges for crawl space foundations. Spring rainfall and seasonal water table fluctuations push moisture through foundation vents and soil. Permanent solutions require vapor barriers, encapsulation, and sometimes sump pump installation—we provide recommendations alongside emergency extraction."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save original hardwood floors after water damage?",
      answer: "Often, yes—if we respond quickly and use controlled drying protocols. Del Ray's original oak and pine floors deserve preservation efforts. We extract water immediately, use dehumidifiers to control moisture removal rates, and monitor floors daily to prevent cupping. Severely damaged sections may need replacement, but we minimize loss."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I replace all my plumbing after a pipe burst?",
      answer: "If your Del Ray home still has original galvanized supply lines or cast iron drains, comprehensive replacement often makes sense. One failure indicates system-wide aging. We provide honest assessments of your plumbing condition and coordinate with trusted local plumbers for permanent upgrades that prevent future emergencies."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle water damage in renovated Del Ray homes?",
      answer: "Many Del Ray homes feature modern updates over original infrastructure—new kitchens with old pipes beneath, finished basements above aging foundations. We work carefully to protect your renovations while addressing water damage, accessing concealed spaces without destroying finishes when possible."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with Del Ray's tight lot sizes and street parking?",
      answer: "Yes—we've worked Del Ray's grid streets and small lots for years. Our crews coordinate with neighbors, position equipment respectfully, and complete work efficiently. Del Ray's community-oriented character makes cooperation natural—we're part of that neighborly approach."
