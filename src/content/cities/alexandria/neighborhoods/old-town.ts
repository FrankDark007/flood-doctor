  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: \`Old Town Alexandria represents Northern Virginia's richest architectural heritage: 18th and 19th-century townhouses with original plaster walls, hand-laid brick foundations, and irreplaceable historic details. Water damage in these properties demands specialized expertise that balances emergency response with preservation requirements. Generic restoration companies demolish first and ask questions later—destroying historic fabric that can never be replaced.

Flood Doctor has restored water-damaged properties throughout the Old & Historic District for nearly two decades. We've dried original horsehair plaster walls without causing shrinkage cracks, extracted floodwater from basement apartments below the Potomac's water table, and navigated Board of Architectural Review requirements for dozens of exterior restoration projects. When Old Town property owners face water emergencies, they call restoration specialists who understand the difference between preservation and replacement.

The neighborhood's unique challenges require uncommon expertise. Combined sewer systems that back up during heavy rainfall. Original brick foundations without modern waterproofing. Cast iron plumbing installed in the 1920s finally reaching failure point. Proximity to the Potomac creating elevated groundwater conditions. We've encountered every water damage scenario Old Town buildings present—and developed restoration approaches that protect both structure and historical integrity.\`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "Do I need BAR approval for water damage restoration?",
      answer: "Exterior work visible from public streets requires Board of Architectural Review approval. Interior restoration typically doesn't require BAR review, but we follow preservation best practices throughout. Our team handles all BAR documentation when needed, working directly with preservation staff to expedite approvals."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my Old Town basement flood every spring?",
      answer: "Proximity to the Potomac River creates elevated groundwater conditions March-June. High water table pushes moisture through original brick foundations lacking modern waterproofing. Permanent solutions require interior drainage systems and sump pumps—we provide recommendations alongside emergency extraction."
    },
    {
      question: "Can original plaster walls be saved after water damage?",
      answer: "Often, yes—if structural integrity remains and water exposure wasn't prolonged. We use controlled drying protocols that prevent shrinkage cracks, preserving irreplaceable historic plaster. Severely damaged sections require removal, but we minimize loss and match repairs to existing finishes."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes combined sewer backups in Old Town?",
      answer: "Old Town's combined sewer system carries both sanitary sewage and stormwater in the same pipes. Heavy rainfall exceeds system capacity, causing backups through basement floor drains. Backwater valves prevent these backups—we provide Category 3 decontamination and coordinate valve installation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle Old Town's narrow streets and parking?",
      answer: "We coordinate with Alexandria parking enforcement to secure emergency access permits, position extraction trucks on main corridors like King Street and Washington Street, and run hoses up to 300 feet when necessary. Logistics expertise ensures rapid response despite access challenges."
