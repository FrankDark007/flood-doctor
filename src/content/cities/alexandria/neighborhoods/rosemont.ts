  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Rosemont's tree-canopied streets and well-maintained homes represent Alexandria's established neighborhood character at its finest. The community's mix of 1930s-1950s colonials, Cape Cods, and ramblers attracts families who value walkability, strong schools, and the stability of a neighborhood that's weathered decades while maintaining its appeal. These homes embody quality construction from an era when craftsmanship mattered—but also aging infrastructure that eventually demands attention.

Flood Doctor has served Rosemont homeowners for nearly two decades. We've extracted basement flooding after summer storms, dried out finished lower levels following water heater failures, and restored homes after cast iron sewer line failures released sewage into living spaces. We understand the pride Rosemont residents take in their homes and the importance of restoration that respects these properties' character.

Rosemont's mature landscape creates unique water damage risks. Tree roots infiltrate clay sewer pipes installed 70-90 years ago. Expansive clay soils shift with seasonal moisture changes, stressing foundations and plumbing connections. Original galvanized supply lines corrode from decades of use. We've developed expertise in the specific challenges Rosemont's housing stock presents, providing both emergency response and permanent solutions.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "Why do Rosemont homes have tree root sewer problems?",
      answer: "Rosemont's beautiful mature trees seek moisture and nutrients in sewer lines. Original clay pipes installed 1930s-1950s develop cracks from age and ground movement. Tree roots infiltrate these cracks, eventually creating blockages that cause sewage backups. We provide emergency cleanup and coordinate with sewer specialists for permanent root removal and pipe replacement or lining."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I replace my galvanized pipes before they fail?",
      answer: "Galvanized pipes installed 70-90 years ago are living on borrowed time. Interior corrosion gradually restricts flow and weakens walls until catastrophic failure occurs. If one section has burst, system-wide replacement often makes financial sense—preventing future emergencies and increasing home value. We provide honest condition assessments and coordinate with trusted local plumbers."
    },
    {
      question: "How does clay soil cause water damage?",
      answer: "Northern Virginia clay soils expand when wet and shrink when dry. This seasonal movement creates foundation cracks, stresses plumbing connections, and changes drainage patterns. Rosemont's mature landscapes and aged infrastructure compound these effects. We address immediate water damage and recommend permanent solutions addressing soil-related movement."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work with Rosemont's HOA requirements?",
      answer: "While Rosemont doesn't have an overarching HOA, some sections have specific requirements. We coordinate with any neighborhood associations, maintain respectful work practices, and ensure restoration meets community standards. Our long history in Alexandria established neighborhoods means we understand working within community expectations."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle insurance claims for older homes?",
      answer: "Yes—we document damage thoroughly, prepare detailed estimates, and work directly with insurance adjusters. Older home claims sometimes face questions about maintenance versus sudden failure. Our expertise in Rosemont's construction helps explain age-related infrastructure issues versus neglect, supporting appropriate coverage under your policy."
