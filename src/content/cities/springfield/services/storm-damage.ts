    paragraphs: [
      `When severe weather crosses Fairfax County, Springfield's mature neighborhoods take the hit. The trees that shade your West Springfield split-level can drop limbs through roofs, crash into vehicles, or pull down power lines. Add wind-driven rain, hail damage, and overwhelmed storm drainage, and a single storm can create multiple damage types across your property.

Flood Doctor responds to storm damage throughout Springfield within 30 minutes of safe travel conditions. We've tarped roofs in Franconia during active weather, extracted storm water from Kingstowne townhomes, and coordinated tree removal with restoration at Rolling Valley properties. Storm damage requires rapid response to prevent secondary water damage—every hour a compromised roof leaks, restoration costs climb.`,

      `Springfield's storm damage reflects its housing mix. Established neighborhoods in West Springfield and Newington feature mature trees that create debris impact risk. Kingstowne's townhomes share roofs and walls, meaning one unit's damage can affect neighbors. Split-level designs with below-grade living spaces face higher flood risk during heavy rainfall.

We coordinate all aspects of storm restoration: emergency tarping, water extraction, structural drying, debris removal coordination, and insurance documentation. One call handles everything—from the moment the storm passes until your property is restored.`

    localContext: "Springfield's combination of mature trees, varied housing types, and split-level designs creates compound storm damage scenarios. A single event can damage roofs, flood lower levels, and destroy landscaping simultaneously."

      question: "When should I call after storm damage?",
      answer: "Call immediately once it's safe. Even if you're not sure about damage extent, early assessment and emergency tarping prevent secondary water damage. We respond to Springfield calls within 30 minutes of safe travel conditions—often while rain is still falling."
    },
    {
      question: "A tree fell on my Springfield home. What do I do?",
      answer: "Evacuate if structural integrity is questionable, then call us. We assess safety, coordinate tree removal, provide emergency weatherproofing, and handle resulting water and structural damage. Don't attempt to move tree limbs yourself—shifting weight can cause additional collapse."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call my insurance company or you first?",
      answer: "Call us first—we can begin emergency services and documentation immediately. Notify your insurance company soon after, but don't wait for their approval before emergency weatherproofing. Preventing additional damage protects your claim and your property."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have hidden storm damage?",
      answer: "After storms, inspect attics for daylight (indicating roof damage), check basements and lower levels for water entry, look for ceiling stains or wet walls, and examine exterior siding. However, much storm damage isn't visible to homeowners. Professional assessment catches damage you might miss."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We document all damage, photograph before and after conditions, provide detailed scope reports, and work directly with adjusters. Professional documentation typically supports better claim outcomes than homeowner-only documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "What about storm damage in Kingstowne townhomes?",
      answer: "Townhome storm damage may affect shared roofs and walls. We coordinate with HOAs, communicate with affected neighbors, and handle the complexities of multi-unit structures. Professional documentation is especially important when damage affects multiple properties."
