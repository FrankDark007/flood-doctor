    paragraphs: [
      `Summer storms roll through Northern Virginia with little warning. One moment your West Springfield split-level is peaceful; an hour later, six inches of rain has overwhelmed storm drains, breached window wells, and sent muddy water cascading into your finished lower level. Your family room, home office, and kids' play area—spaces you use every day—now sit under brown water.

Flood Doctor has cleaned up after every major storm event in Springfield since 2005. We've pumped out Kingstowne townhomes after flash floods, extracted storm water from Franconia colonials, and restored Rolling Valley properties after summer deluges. When NOAA issues a flash flood warning for Fairfax County, our phones light up with Springfield addresses—and our trucks are already positioned to respond.`,

      `Flood cleanup differs from typical water damage. Storm water carries soil, debris, and contaminants that complicate restoration. The clay-laden runoff from Springfield's hills deposits sediment in carpet fibers, flooring, and HVAC systems. Flash floods overwhelm sump pumps, breach foundation walls, and create contamination categories that require specialized protocols.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand Springfield's flood patterns: the lower-lying areas near Lake Accotink, the storm drainage limits along Backlick Road, and the split-level vulnerabilities that create flood risk throughout the area. We don't just pump and leave—we extract, decontaminate, and restore.`
    ],
    localContext: "Springfield's topography and housing stock create unique flood risks. Lower-lying areas near Lake Accotink, combined with split-level construction that places living space below grade, make Springfield particularly vulnerable during severe summer storms."

    {
      question: "Should I wait until the storm passes to call for flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Call immediately, even during the storm. We dispatch when it's safe to travel—often before rain fully stops. Earlier calls mean earlier response times. Standing flood water continues damaging your Springfield home every hour it remains. Our crews know the area's roads and can reach your neighborhood as soon as conditions allow."
    },
    {
      question: "Is flood water from a storm contaminated?",
      answer: "Almost always yes. Storm water picks up soil bacteria, lawn chemicals, animal waste, and debris as it flows. If it mixed with sewage backup—common during heavy storms—it's Category 3 biohazard. We assess contamination level and apply appropriate protocols. Don't wade through flood water without protection."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flood damage from a storm?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance typically covers storm damage, including water intrusion from overwhelmed drainage, window well flooding, and sump pump failure. Separate flood insurance is needed for rising water events. We document everything for your claim and work directly with adjusters."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take in a Springfield home?",
      answer: "Initial water extraction takes hours; complete drying takes 5-10 days depending on affected area and materials. Springfield's finished lower levels require thorough, monitored drying. Rushing creates mold problems later. We provide daily updates and realistic timelines."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my furniture and belongings be saved after flooding?",
      answer: "Many items can be cleaned and restored. We assess each item, separate salvageable from unsalvageable, and provide content cleaning services. Porous materials that absorbed contaminated water—like upholstered furniture in Category 3 flooding—typically require disposal for health reasons."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle flood cleanup in Kingstowne townhomes?",
      answer: "Yes, and we understand the additional complexity. Townhome flooding may affect shared walls and require HOA coordination. We communicate with property management, document damage thoroughly, and work efficiently to minimize disruption to you and your neighbors."
