    paragraphs: [
      `After firefighters leave your Springfield property, the real restoration challenge begins. The fire may be out, but smoke has penetrated every room, soot coats surfaces far from the flames, and water from suppression efforts saturates floors and walls. Your West Springfield split-level—with its finished lower level, family rooms, and personal belongings—now requires specialized restoration that most companies aren't equipped to provide.

Flood Doctor has restored fire-damaged properties throughout Springfield for nearly two decades. We've removed soot from Kingstowne townhome kitchens, eliminated smoke odor from Franconia colonials, and dried fire suppression water from Newington basements. Fire damage restoration combines smoke and soot cleaning, odor elimination, water damage restoration, and content cleaning—we handle all of it.`,

      `Springfield's homes present varied fire restoration challenges. Split-levels with complex layouts mean smoke travels through multiple levels. Kingstowne townhomes share walls, and smoke can migrate between units. Older West Springfield and Newington construction may contain materials that complicate restoration. HVAC systems spread smoke throughout homes before the fire is even extinguished.

We respond within hours of fire department clearance, beginning the restoration process while damage is still fresh. Early intervention saves more of your property—soot continues etching surfaces and smoke odor sets deeper every day.`

      question: "When can you start fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "We respond within hours of fire department clearance. The fire department must release the property first—usually after investigation. Call us as soon as the fire is out; we'll coordinate timing and arrive as soon as we're permitted access."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is fast response important after a fire?",
      answer: "Soot is acidic and continues etching surfaces every day. Smoke odor sets deeper into porous materials over time. Water from suppression efforts can cause mold growth within 24-48 hours. Early intervention saves more of your Springfield property and reduces overall restoration costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can smoke odor really be eliminated?",
      answer: "Yes, with professional treatment. We use thermal fogging, hydroxyl generators, and ozone treatments to eliminate odor at the molecular level—not just mask it. For Springfield homes with extensive smoke exposure, this process is essential. DIY approaches typically fail."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my personal belongings after a fire?",
      answer: "We inventory, clean, and restore salvageable items. Electronics receive specialized cleaning, fabrics are ozone-treated, hard items are cleaned appropriately. Items that can't be restored are documented for insurance. Your Springfield home's contents receive individual attention."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "Yes—fire damage is a standard covered peril in homeowner's policies. We work directly with insurance adjusters, document all damage and restoration efforts, and support your claim throughout the process. Professional documentation typically results in more complete coverage."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does fire restoration take?",
      answer: "Timelines vary dramatically. A contained fire with limited smoke might take 1-2 weeks. Significant fires requiring demolition and reconstruction can take months. We provide realistic timelines after assessment and keep you informed throughout the process."
