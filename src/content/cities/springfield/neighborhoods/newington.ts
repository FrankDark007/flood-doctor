  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Newington serves as home to many Fort Belvoir families—military members and civilians who serve our country. When water threatens these homes, you need restoration experts who understand military life: deployments that mean you can't always be home, PCS timelines that create urgency, and the need for efficient, professional service.

Flood Doctor has served Newington families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from ramblers near Telegraph Road, dried the colonials of military families preparing for moves, and protected the established homes that define this neighborhood. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Newington, not in a distant warehouse—when you call about a water emergency, we're already nearby.

The housing here—primarily 1970s-era ramblers, split-levels, and colonials—requires specialized attention. These homes have aging copper plumbing, original sump systems, and infrastructure that's now 50 years old. We understand the unique challenges of Newington's established housing stock.`,
