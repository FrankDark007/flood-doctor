    introduction: `You've discovered water in your McLean home—a flooded basement, a burst pipe, an overflowing appliance. In this moment, the actions you take determine whether this becomes a manageable restoration project or a catastrophic loss.

This guide provides the immediate steps that protect your family, minimize damage, and set up successful restoration. Keep it accessible—these aren't steps you'll want to research while water is actively flooding your home.`,

        heading: "First 5 Minutes: Safety Assessment",
        content: `Before touching anything:

**Check for electrical hazards.** If water is anywhere near electrical outlets, appliances, or your electrical panel, DO NOT enter the water. Standing water with electrical contact can be instantly fatal. If you're uncertain about electrical safety, stay out and call professionals.

**Turn off electricity if safe to do so.** If you can reach your electrical panel without entering water, turn off breakers to affected areas. If the panel itself is in or near water, leave it alone and call your utility company.

**Identify the water source.** Is this clean water from a supply line? Gray water from a washing machine or dishwasher? Black water from a sewer backup or external flooding? The source determines appropriate safety measures and cleanup requirements.

**Stop the source if possible.** Turn off the main water supply for burst pipes. Shut off appliance supply valves for appliance failures. For sewer backup or external flooding, you may not be able to stop the source—focus on other protective measures.

**Check for structural safety.** Severe flooding can compromise structural integrity. If floors feel soft, walls are bowing, or ceilings are sagging, evacuate immediately and call professionals before re-entering.`

        heading: "Minutes 5-15: Damage Mitigation",
        content: `Once safety is assured, focus on minimizing ongoing damage:

**Elevate what you can.** Move furniture, electronics, documents, and valuables above water level. Use tables, shelving, or even stacked books to elevate items. Prioritize irreplaceable items first.

**Remove rugs and area textiles.** Wet rugs left on hardwood or carpet accelerate damage to underlying surfaces. If you can safely move them, get rugs off floors and draining outside.

**Document everything.** Before moving anything else, take photos and video of the flooding from multiple angles. Document the water level, affected areas, and damage visible. This documentation is essential for insurance claims.

**Don't run household HVAC.** Your heating/cooling system can distribute moisture throughout the house, spreading damage to unaffected areas. Turn off the system until professionals advise otherwise.

**Open interior doors.** Air circulation aids drying. Open doors between rooms, open cabinet doors, and create airflow where possible.

**Call Flood Doctor: (703) 656-0101.** Professional response within 15 minutes to McLean addresses. We begin extraction and drying while you handle documentation and insurance notification.`

        heading: "What NOT to Do During Flooding",
        content: `Some common instincts actually worsen the situation:

**Don't use household vacuums.** Standard vacuums aren't designed for water and pose electrocution risk. Shop vacs rated for wet pickup can be used for small amounts of clean water only—but professional extraction is far more effective.

**Don't ignore "small" amounts of water.** Water travels. A small visible puddle often indicates much more moisture behind walls, under floors, or in cavities. What looks manageable frequently isn't.

**Don't wait to see if it dries on its own.** Mold begins growing within 24-48 hours. "Waiting to see" whether professional help is needed often means guaranteed mold problems and much more extensive restoration.

**Don't enter sewage water.** Category 3 water (sewage backup, external flooding) contains dangerous pathogens. Professional biohazard response is required—DIY sewage cleanup poses serious health risks.

**Don't throw away damaged items immediately.** Your insurance adjuster may need to see damaged items to process claims. Document everything before disposal, and ask your adjuster before throwing anything away.

**Don't trust the "damp but okay" assessment.** Materials that feel damp but not soaked often contain much more moisture than they appear to. Professional moisture meters reveal true conditions that tactile assessment misses.`

        heading: "The First Hour: Professional Response",
        content: `When Flood Doctor arrives at your McLean home:

**Assessment.** We evaluate water source, affected areas, and current moisture levels throughout the structure. Our moisture meters identify water migration you can't see.

**Water extraction.** Truck-mounted extraction removes water far faster than any consumer equipment. For McLean homes with finished basements—home theaters, wine cellars, guest suites—rapid extraction prevents catastrophic damage to high-value finishes.

**Content protection.** We identify and protect items that can be saved, document items for insurance, and begin content handling for items requiring specialty cleaning.

**Initial drying setup.** Industrial air movers and dehumidifiers begin the drying process immediately. Proper setup considers the structure, materials, and moisture distribution we identified in assessment.

**Insurance coordination.** We document extensively, provide detailed estimates, and work directly with insurance adjusters. McLean homeowners often have high-value claims—professional documentation supports complete coverage.

Our 15-minute response time to McLean addresses means drying begins while most companies are still taking your information.`

      {
        heading: "Hours 2-24: Ongoing Restoration",
        content: `Initial response continues into comprehensive restoration:

**Moisture monitoring.** We track moisture levels throughout the structure, adjusting drying equipment as conditions change. This monitoring continues until all materials reach target moisture content.

**Material evaluation.** Some materials—carpet, drywall, insulation—may require removal. Others can be dried in place. We make these determinations based on water category, saturation level, and material type.

**Mold prevention.** Fast drying is the primary mold prevention. When conditions indicate elevated risk, antimicrobial treatments provide additional protection.

**Structural drying.** Behind walls, beneath floors, and in cavities—water often hides where you can't see it. Our drying protocols address these hidden areas, preventing the long-term damage that occurs when hidden moisture goes untreated.

**Documentation continuation.** We photograph progress, log equipment placement and readings, and maintain detailed records throughout the restoration. This documentation supports insurance claims and provides you complete visibility into the process.`

        heading: "Insurance Considerations for McLean Homeowners",
        content: `McLean homes often involve significant claims. Navigate insurance effectively:

**Report promptly.** Contact your insurance company within 24 hours of discovering water damage. Delayed reporting can complicate claims.

**Don't authorize work you'll claim without documentation.** Before any restoration work, ensure everything is documented. Photos, videos, moisture readings, and written descriptions all support claims.

**Understand your coverage.** Most homeowner's policies cover sudden and accidental water damage—burst pipes, appliance failures, etc. They typically don't cover gradual damage, flood damage (requires separate flood insurance), or damage from neglected maintenance.

**Review coverage limits.** McLean's high-value homes may have coverage limits below replacement costs for finished basements and contents. Review your policy annually and adjust as needed.

**Flood Doctor handles insurance directly.** We provide insurance-ready documentation, work directly with adjusters, and handle billing for covered work. This removes burden during an already stressful situation.`

        heading: "After the Emergency: Recovery Timeline",
        content: `Understanding the timeline helps manage expectations:

**Days 1-3:** Active extraction and initial drying. Equipment throughout affected areas. Living disruption is highest during this period.

**Days 3-5:** Moisture levels declining. Equipment may be consolidated. We monitor and adjust to ensure complete drying.

**Days 5-10:** Reaching target moisture levels. Equipment removal once goals are achieved. Assessment of what reconstruction, if any, is needed.

**Weeks 2-4+:** Reconstruction of any removed materials. Painting, flooring, trim work as needed. Final restoration to pre-loss condition.

Timeline varies significantly based on flood extent, water category, and materials affected. We provide specific projections based on your situation.`
