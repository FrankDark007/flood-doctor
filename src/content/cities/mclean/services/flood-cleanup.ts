    headline: "Professional Flood Cleanup for McLean Estate Homes",
    paragraphs: [
      `Summer storms roll through Northern Virginia with little warning. One moment your Langley estate is peaceful; an hour later, eight inches of rain has overwhelmed storm drains, breached window wells, and sent muddy water cascading into your finished basement. Your wine cellar, home theater, and guest quarters—spaces you've invested years perfecting—now sit under brown water.

Flood Doctor has cleaned up after every major storm event in McLean since 2005. We've pumped out The Reserve's gated estates after flash floods, extracted storm water from Chesterbrook colonials, and restored Woodside Estates properties after summer deluges. When NOAA issues a flash flood warning for Fairfax County, our phones light up with McLean addresses—and our trucks are already positioned to respond.`,

      `Flood cleanup differs from typical water damage. Storm water carries soil, debris, and contaminants that complicate restoration. The clay-laden runoff from McLean's hills deposits sediment in carpet fibers, hardwood grain, and HVAC systems. Flash floods overwhelm sump pumps, breach foundation walls, and create contamination categories that require specialized protocols.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand McLean's flood patterns: the low-lying areas near Potomac tributaries, the window well vulnerabilities in Balls Hill properties, the overwhelmed storm drains along Georgetown Pike. We don't just pump and leave—we extract, decontaminate, and restore.`
    ],
    localContext: "McLean's topography creates unique flood risks. Properties near creek tributaries, low-lying sections of Salona Village, and homes along natural drainage paths face higher flooding probability during severe storms."

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "Should I wait until the storm passes to call for flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Call immediately, even during the storm. We dispatch when it's safe to travel—often before rain fully stops. Earlier calls mean earlier response times. Standing flood water continues damaging your McLean home every hour it remains. Our crews know McLean's roads and can reach Langley, Chesterbrook, and The Reserve as soon as conditions allow."
    },
    {
      question: "Is flood water from a storm contaminated?",
      answer: "Almost always yes. Storm water picks up soil bacteria, lawn chemicals, animal waste, and debris as it flows. If it mixed with sewage backup—common during heavy storms—it's Category 3 biohazard. We assess contamination level and apply appropriate protocols. Don't wade through flood water without protection."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flood damage from a storm?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance typically covers storm damage, including water intrusion from overwhelmed drainage, window well flooding, and sump pump failure. Separate flood insurance is needed for rising water events. We document everything for your claim and work directly with adjusters."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take in a McLean home?",
      answer: "Initial water extraction takes hours; complete drying takes 5-10 days depending on affected area and materials. McLean's finished basements with custom millwork require careful, monitored drying. Rushing creates mold problems later. We provide daily updates and realistic timelines."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my furniture and belongings be saved after flooding?",
      answer: "Many items can be cleaned and restored. We assess each item, separate salvageable from unsalvageable, and provide content cleaning services. Porous materials that absorbed contaminated water—like upholstered furniture in Category 3 flooding—typically require disposal for health reasons."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my wine cellar after flooding?",
      answer: "Wine cellars are a specialty for McLean flood cleanup. We protect your collection during extraction, maintain temperature stability when possible, and use controlled drying that won't shock your wines. Bottles themselves typically survive flooding—it's the cellar environment we restore."
