    paragraphs: [
      `That musty smell in your Langley basement isn't just unpleasant—it's a warning sign of mold growth that may have spread far beyond what you can see. McLean's estate homes, with their extensive finished basements, complex HVAC systems, and mature landscaping, create environments where mold thrives hidden from view. By the time you notice the smell or see discoloration, colonies have often established throughout wall cavities and under flooring.

Flood Doctor's IICRC-certified mold remediation technicians have cleared mold from McLean properties for nearly two decades. We've remediated hidden growth in The Reserve's wine cellars, eliminated mold colonies behind the walls of Chesterbrook colonials, and restored healthy air quality in Woodside Estates homes where previous water damage went unaddressed. Mold doesn't respect property values—your million-dollar estate is just as vulnerable as any home.`,

      `McLean's mold challenges stem from its housing characteristics. Clay soil creates high water tables that increase basement humidity. Mature trees in Langley and Salona Village shade foundations, preventing natural drying. Finished basements with poor ventilation trap moisture. Large HVAC systems spread spores throughout 10,000-square-foot homes before anyone notices the source.

We don't simply spray bleach and hope for the best. Professional mold remediation requires containment, HEPA filtration, source elimination, surface treatment, and verification testing. For McLean homeowners with health concerns, real estate transactions pending, or visible mold growth, proper remediation protects both health and property value.`

    localContext: "McLean's combination of finished basements, high property values, and discerning homeowners demands thorough mold remediation. Incomplete work shows up in home inspections, affects resale, and puts families at risk."

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have a mold problem in my McLean home?",
      answer: "Warning signs include musty odors, visible discoloration on walls or ceilings, water stains, condensation on windows, and unexplained respiratory symptoms that improve when you're away from home. McLean's finished basements often hide mold behind walls—if you had water damage that wasn't professionally dried, mold may have developed unseen."
    },
    {
      question: "Is black mold dangerous?",
      answer: "Stachybotrys ('black mold') produces mycotoxins and requires careful remediation with full containment. However, mold color doesn't determine danger—many dark molds are harmless while some lighter species are problematic. Professional testing identifies species. Regardless of type, visible mold in your home should be remediated."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I clean mold myself?",
      answer: "Small areas (under 10 square feet) of surface mold on non-porous materials can sometimes be cleaned by homeowners. However, mold in wall cavities, HVAC systems, or porous materials requires professional remediation. Improper cleaning spreads spores throughout your McLean home. When in doubt, get professional assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold come back after remediation?",
      answer: "Not if the moisture source is corrected. Mold requires moisture to grow—eliminate the water problem and mold won't return. Our remediation includes moisture source identification. For McLean basements with chronic humidity, this may involve dehumidification systems or waterproofing improvements."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does mold remediation take?",
      answer: "Most residential projects take 3-7 days depending on scope. McLean's larger homes with extensive growth may take longer. Testing results take 2-3 additional days. We provide realistic timelines after assessment—thorough remediation takes time but protects your family and property value."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold remediation affect my home's resale value?",
      answer: "Proper remediation with third-party clearance testing actually protects value. Undisclosed or improperly treated mold creates liability and negotiation leverage for buyers. Many McLean real estate transactions include mold inspection—having documented professional remediation with clearance certification is far better than visible problems."
