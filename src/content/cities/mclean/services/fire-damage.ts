    paragraphs: [
      `After firefighters leave your McLean property, the real restoration challenge begins. The fire may be out, but smoke has penetrated every room, soot coats surfaces far from the flames, and water from suppression efforts saturates floors and walls. Your Langley estate—with its custom millwork, hardwood floors, and carefully curated interiors—now requires specialized restoration that most companies aren't equipped to provide.

Flood Doctor has restored fire-damaged properties throughout McLean for nearly two decades. We've removed soot from The Reserve's custom kitchens, eliminated smoke odor from Chesterbrook colonials, and dried fire suppression water from Woodside Estates basements. Fire damage restoration combines smoke and soot cleaning, odor elimination, water damage restoration, and content cleaning—we handle all of it.`,

      `McLean's estate homes present unique fire restoration challenges. Larger square footage means more surfaces for smoke absorption. Custom materials—hardwood, natural stone, specialty fabrics—require cleaning approaches different from builder-grade finishes. HVAC systems spread smoke throughout 10,000+ square feet before the fire is even extinguished. Wine cellars, home theaters, and art collections require specialized protection.

We respond within hours of fire department clearance, beginning the restoration process while damage is still fresh. Early intervention saves more of your property—soot continues etching surfaces and smoke odor sets deeper every day.`

    localContext: "McLean's estate homes—with their custom finishes, extensive square footage, and high-value contents—require fire restoration expertise beyond typical residential work. We approach each property with the thoroughness these investments deserve."

      question: "When can you start fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "We respond within hours of fire department clearance. The fire department must release the property first—usually after investigation. Call us as soon as the fire is out; we'll coordinate timing and arrive as soon as we're permitted access."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is fast response important after a fire?",
      answer: "Soot is acidic and continues etching surfaces every day. Smoke odor sets deeper into porous materials over time. Water from suppression efforts can cause mold growth within 24-48 hours. Early intervention saves more of your McLean property and reduces overall restoration costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can smoke odor really be eliminated?",
      answer: "Yes, with professional treatment. We use thermal fogging, hydroxyl generators, and ozone treatments to eliminate odor at the molecular level—not just mask it. For McLean homes with extensive smoke exposure, this process is essential. DIY approaches typically fail."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my personal belongings after a fire?",
      answer: "We inventory, clean, and restore salvageable items. Electronics receive specialized cleaning, fabrics are ozone-treated, hard items are ultrasonically cleaned. Items that can't be restored are documented for insurance. Your McLean home's contents receive individual attention."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "Yes—fire damage is a standard covered peril in homeowner's policies. We work directly with insurance adjusters, document all damage and restoration efforts, and support your claim throughout the process. Professional documentation typically results in more complete coverage."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does fire restoration take?",
      answer: "Timelines vary dramatically. A contained fire with limited smoke might take 1-2 weeks. Significant fires requiring demolition and reconstruction can take months. We provide realistic timelines after assessment and keep you informed throughout the process."
