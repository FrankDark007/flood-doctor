    paragraphs: [
      `Few emergencies create more urgent health hazards than sewage backup. When raw sewage floods into your McLean basement through floor drains, backing up from overtaxed sewer lines or failed septic systems, every minute of exposure increases contamination spread. Your finished basement—the wine cellar, home theater, guest quarters you've invested in—now sits in Category 3 biohazardous waste.

Flood Doctor maintains biohazard certification specifically for these emergencies. We've cleaned up sewage backups throughout McLean: storm-overwhelmed sewer lines in Langley, septic failures in Great Falls-adjacent properties, and tree root blockages in Chesterbrook's mature neighborhoods. When sewage invades your estate home, we arrive with the PPE, antimicrobial treatments, and disposal protocols the situation demands.`,

      `McLean faces unique sewage risks. Properties near Great Falls—some of the most valuable in Northern Virginia—often operate on private septic systems that can back up during heavy rain or system failure. Older neighborhoods like Langley and McLean Hamlet have mature trees whose roots infiltrate aging sewer lines, creating blockages that cause backup during storms. Even properties on public sewer face backup risk when combined systems overflow.

Our crews don't approach sewage like regular water damage. This is biohazard work requiring specialized training, protective equipment, and disposal procedures that ensure your family's safety.`
    ],
    localContext: "McLean's mix of public sewer and private septic systems creates varied sewage risks. Properties in The Reserve and newer developments connect to Fairfax County sewer; estates toward Great Falls often have private septic. Both can fail, with different implications for cleanup."

    {
      question: "Is sewage backup dangerous to my family?",
      answer: "Yes—sewage contains bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause serious illness. Do not enter contaminated areas, don't attempt cleanup yourself, and keep children and pets away. Call professionals immediately. The longer sewage sits, the more dangerous it becomes and the further contamination spreads."
    },
    {
      question: "What gets thrown away after sewage backup?",
      answer: "Porous materials that absorbed sewage must be disposed of as biohazard waste: carpet, padding, drywall below the contamination line, upholstered furniture, mattresses, and similar items. Hard surfaces like tile, concrete, and sealed wood can often be decontaminated and saved."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover sewage backup?",
      answer: "Most homeowner policies offer sewer backup coverage, either included or as an endorsement. Check your policy or call your agent. We document everything for claims, photograph damage, and provide detailed reports. If you're unsure about coverage, we can help you understand your policy."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until my basement is safe after sewage cleanup?",
      answer: "Proper decontamination takes 5-7 days: extraction, material removal, antimicrobial treatment, drying, and verification. We don't declare spaces safe until treatment is complete and verified. For McLean families with health-sensitive members, this thoroughness matters."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes sewer line backups in McLean?",
      answer: "McLean's mature trees—especially in Langley and Chesterbrook—send roots into aging sewer lines. Heavy storms can overwhelm system capacity. Older properties may have deteriorating clay pipes. We recommend camera inspection after backup to identify the cause and prevent recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with septic system backups?",
      answer: "Yes. Many McLean properties toward Great Falls operate on private septic. Septic backups require the same biohazard protocols as sewer backups. After cleanup, we can connect you with septic specialists to address the system failure that caused the backup."
