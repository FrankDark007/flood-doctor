    headline: "Protecting McLean's Estate Homes from Water Damage",
    paragraphs: [
      `When water infiltrates your McLean estate, the stakes are higher than a typical suburban home. Your 8,000-square-foot Langley colonial isn't just a house—it's an investment in custom millwork, hardwood floors sourced from sustainable forests, and a finished basement that might include a temperature-controlled wine cellar worth more than most vehicles.

Flood Doctor has restored water-damaged properties throughout McLean for nearly two decades. We've extracted standing water from The Reserve's gated estates, dried the home theaters of Chesterbrook families, and prevented mold growth in the historic properties along Georgetown Pike. When your Woodside Estates neighbor recommends a restoration company, they mention us—because we've already served their cul-de-sac.`,

      `McLean's water damage challenges differ from typical Northern Virginia homes. The clay soil that provides stable foundations also shifts during wet seasons, creating hairline cracks that allow water intrusion. Mature oaks in Salona Village and Balls Hill—the same trees that provide your neighborhood's character—can send roots into aging sewer lines, causing backups during heavy storms. The high water tables near Chain Bridge create persistent basement moisture that generic restoration companies don't understand how to address.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers don't just pump water and leave. We understand that your McLean Hamlet property requires precision drying to protect original plaster walls, that your El Nido estate's inlaid floors need controlled humidity to prevent warping, and that your Langley Farms wine collection demands specialized attention during any restoration project.`
    ],
    localContext: "McLean's estate homes—ranging from 4,000 to 15,000+ square feet—require restoration expertise most companies simply don't have. We've protected irreplaceable assets in The Reserve, Woodside Estates, and throughout the Georgetown Pike corridor since 2005."

This cycle creates foundation shifts and hairline cracks that allow groundwater intrusion—especially in the established neighborhoods of Chesterbrook, Langley, and McLean Hamlet where homes were built decades ago.",

      question: "How quickly should I call after discovering water damage in my McLean home?",
      answer: "Immediately. Water damage worsens exponentially—mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours, and water continues migrating into wall cavities, under floors, and through ceiling spaces. In McLean's large estates, a few hours of delay can mean thousands of additional dollars in damage. Call (703) 656-0101 the moment you discover water."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save my hardwood floors after water damage?",
      answer: "Often, yes. McLean's estate homes frequently feature high-quality hardwood that responds well to professional drying. The key is rapid response and controlled drying—slow, steady moisture removal prevents the warping and cupping that destroys flooring. We've saved irreplaceable hardwood in Langley, Chesterbrook, and throughout the Georgetown Pike corridor."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my wine cellar—can you dry it without damaging my collection?",
      answer: "Wine cellar restoration is a specialty for McLean properties. We use low-temperature drying methods and maintain humidity levels that protect your collection while removing moisture from walls and floors. Your bottles remain safely stored or are carefully relocated while we address the water damage."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work directly with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We handle direct billing with all major carriers and provide the detailed documentation insurance adjusters require. Our estimates, moisture readings, daily logs, and photo documentation support your claim. Many McLean homeowners find that professional documentation actually improves their claim outcomes."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent mold after water damage?",
      answer: "Thorough drying within 24-48 hours prevents most mold growth. We use industrial dehumidifiers and air movers to reduce moisture to safe levels, then verify with both pinless meters and thermal imaging. For McLean's larger homes, this often takes 4-7 days of monitored drying—rushing the process invites mold problems later."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between your service and national chains like SERVPRO?",
      answer: "We're locally owned and McLean-focused. Our crews know the neighborhoods, understand estate home construction, and are positioned for 30-minute response. National franchises often dispatch from distant locations and lack expertise in McLean's specific challenges—clay soil, mature tree root issues, and high-end home restoration requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help if my private well or septic system caused the water damage?",
      answer: "Yes. Many McLean properties—especially near Great Falls—use private well and septic systems. Septic backups are Category 3 (biohazard) situations requiring specialized cleanup protocols. We're certified for all contamination categories and coordinate with well and septic specialists as needed."
