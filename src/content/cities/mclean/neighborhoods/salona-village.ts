  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Salona Village offers the quiet enclave experience that draws families to McLean: tree-lined streets, established homes with character, and proximity to downtown McLean without the traffic intensity. The neighborhood's mix of well-maintained colonials and modernized properties represents generations of family investment—investments that water damage can devastate in hours.

Flood Doctor has protected Salona Village homes for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements after summer storms, dried finished lower levels after supply line failures, and prevented mold growth in crawlspaces throughout the neighborhood. When Salona Village families gather at neighborhood events, our name comes up in home service conversations—because we've already earned their trust.

The housing stock here—primarily 1960s-1980s colonials with modern updates—presents the characteristic challenges of established McLean neighborhoods. Aging infrastructure behind renovated surfaces. Mature trees with extensive root systems. Clay soil that shifts with seasons. We understand what lies beneath Salona Village's polished exteriors and respond accordingly.`,

    {
      question: "How do you handle renovated homes with older infrastructure?",
      answer: "Salona Village is full of updated homes with original underlying systems. We work carefully to protect your renovations while addressing water damage. When a supply line fails behind modern cabinets, we access, repair, and restore without destroying your updates."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do Salona Village basements flood?",
      answer: "Older sump pumps, clay soil that shifts seasonally, and storm drainage designed decades ago combine to create flood risk. We address immediate flooding and can recommend upgrades to prevent recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "What about tree root sewer problems?",
      answer: "Salona Village's mature trees—beautiful assets—can infiltrate older clay sewer pipes. When roots cause backup, we handle biohazard cleanup professionally. We recommend camera inspection to assess root intrusion extent."
