  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Woodside Estates offers something rare in modern McLean: established luxury with genuine community character. The approximately 200 homes surrounding Woodside Lake—built primarily in the late 1950s and updated over decades—combine generous lots, mature landscaping, and access to private lake amenities. These aren't cookie-cutter properties; they're individual statements of family investment.

Flood Doctor has served Woodside Estates families for nearly two decades. We've extracted water from lake-adjacent properties with unique moisture challenges, dried finished basements in the neighborhood's larger homes, and prevented mold in properties where the lake environment creates persistent humidity. When the Woodside Lake Association members need restoration help, our name circulates—because we've already proven ourselves on these streets.

The housing here—ranging from well-maintained 1950s colonials to extensively renovated estates—presents specific challenges. Lake proximity creates humidity issues. Mature trees on wooded lots send roots into aging infrastructure. Older homes have original systems that eventually fail. We understand Woodside Estates' unique characteristics and respond accordingly.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "Do you understand lake-adjacent property challenges?",
      answer: "Yes. Woodside Lake properties face higher humidity, groundwater pressure, and moisture infiltration risk than inland homes. We bring dehumidification equipment scaled for these conditions and understand the long-term moisture management these properties require."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work with our older 1950s home systems?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Woodside Estates includes many original homes with decades of updates. We carefully work around renovations while addressing original infrastructure. Our goal is preserving your updates while solving the underlying problem."
    },
    {
      question: "Is mold more common near Woodside Lake?",
      answer: "Lake and wooded environments create conditions favorable to mold—higher humidity, organic matter, shaded areas that hold moisture. We provide both emergency mold response and preventive assessment for Woodside properties."
    },
    {
      question: "What about the mature trees and root problems?",
      answer: "Woodside's beautiful mature trees can send roots into aging sewer lines and drain tiles. When this causes backup or flooding, we handle the cleanup and can connect you with specialists to address the root intrusion."
