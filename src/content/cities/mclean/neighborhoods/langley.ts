  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Langley represents McLean at its most prestigious—stately colonials on generous lots, tree-lined streets near some of the nation's most powerful institutions, and a school district that draws families from across the region. When water threatens these investments, you need restoration experts who understand what's at stake.

Flood Doctor has served Langley families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements along Chain Bridge Road, dried finished lower levels near Langley High School, and protected custom millwork in colonials throughout the neighborhood. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Langley, not in a distant warehouse—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—4,000 to 10,000+ square foot colonials and custom homes—requires restoration expertise beyond typical residential work. Finished basements often include home theaters, wine storage, and guest quarters. Original hardwood floors and custom millwork represent significant investment. We treat each Langley property with the thoroughness these homes deserve.`,
