  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Falls Church City represents the historic heart of the Falls Church area—a small independent city with big community character. The walkable downtown along Broad Street, the tree-lined residential streets with 1920s-1960s homes, and the engaged residents who chose this tight-knit community over neighboring suburbs all define what makes Falls Church City special. When water threatens these homes, you need restoration experts who understand both the historic architecture and the community values.

Flood Doctor has served Falls Church City families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements in the historic district, dried original hardwood floors in pre-war bungalows, and protected plaster walls in colonials throughout the City. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Broad Street—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—craftsman bungalows from the 1920s, Cape Cods from the 1940s, colonials from the 1950s and 1960s—requires restoration expertise beyond typical residential work. Original plaster walls, hardwood floors with decades of patina, and vintage millwork all need specialized care. We treat each Falls Church City property with the thoroughness these character homes deserve.`,
