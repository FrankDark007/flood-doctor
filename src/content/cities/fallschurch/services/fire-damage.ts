    headline: "Comprehensive Fire Damage Restoration for Falls Church Homes",
    paragraphs: [
      `Fire damage devastates on multiple levels: the fire itself destroys; firefighting water saturates; smoke and soot permeate. Your Falls Church home needs restoration that addresses all three simultaneously. The 1940s bungalow in Falls Church City with plaster walls requires different treatment than the 1990s townhome near Seven Corners. The Lake Barcroft colonial with finished basement needs attention to spaces untouched by flames but saturated by firefighting efforts.

Flood Doctor responds to Falls Church fire emergencies immediately after fire department clearance. We've restored fire-damaged homes throughout Falls Church City, Seven Corners, Lake Barcroft, and surrounding areas. Our fire damage restoration addresses structural damage, water damage from firefighting, and smoke/soot remediation—the complete scope of fire aftermath.`,

      `What many homeowners don't realize is that fire damage worsens every hour after the fire is extinguished. Water from firefighting efforts continues to soak into walls, floors, and structural materials. Smoke residue becomes harder to remove as it cures on surfaces. Soot—acidic and corrosive—permanently etches metals, stains materials, and penetrates deeper into porous surfaces with each passing day.

Our response begins with emergency board-up and tarping to secure your Falls Church home. Then water extraction prevents secondary water damage from firefighting efforts. Smoke and soot remediation follows, using specialized techniques for the different types of smoke residue (wet smoke, dry smoke, protein smoke) found after different fire types. This comprehensive approach restores your home completely—not just the areas where flames touched.`
    ],
    localContext: "Falls Church's diverse housing stock—from historic bungalows to mid-century colonials to contemporary townhomes—each requires specialized fire damage restoration approaches. We've restored fire-damaged properties throughout Falls Church since 2005."

      question: "When can you start after a fire?",

      question: "Will my homeowners insurance cover fire damage?",

      question: "Can smoke damage be removed from clothing and furniture?",
      answer: "Often, yes. We provide content restoration services that clean smoke-damaged textiles, furniture, electronics, and personal items. Some severely damaged items can't be saved, but many items that appear ruined can be professionally restored."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does smoke odor persist even after cleaning?",
      answer: "Smoke odor penetrates deep into porous materials—not just surfaces. Effective odor elimination requires more than surface cleaning. We use thermal fogging and hydroxyl generators that send deodorizing agents into the same cavities smoke reached, eliminating odor at the source."
    },
    {
      question: "What about rooms that didn't burn but smell like smoke?",
