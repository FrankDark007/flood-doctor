    paragraphs: [
      `When water infiltrates your Falls Church home, you're not dealing with a cookie-cutter restoration job. Your 1940s Cape Cod near Falls Church City isn't the same as a modern townhome near Eden Center—and your restoration company needs to understand the difference. The original hardwood floors in your Seven Corners colonial, the plaster walls in your pre-war bungalow, and the finished basement in your Lake Barcroft waterfront home all require specialized care.

Flood Doctor has restored water-damaged properties throughout Falls Church for nearly two decades. We've extracted standing water from historic homes in Falls Church City, dried the finished basements of Seven Corners families, and prevented mold growth in waterfront properties around Lake Barcroft. When your Pimmit Hills neighbor recommends a restoration company, they mention us—because we've already served their neighborhood.`,

      `Falls Church's water damage challenges reflect its unique character. The aging infrastructure in older neighborhoods—galvanized pipes, original clay tile drains, and vintage sump systems—creates vulnerabilities that newer communities don't face. The high water table near Lake Barcroft affects basements differently than the clay soil issues common in Baileys Crossroads. The legacy storm drainage systems in established neighborhoods can overwhelm during summer thunderstorms.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers don't just pump water and leave. We understand that your Falls Church City bungalow requires gentle drying to protect original plaster, that your Seven Corners colonial's hardwood needs controlled humidity to prevent warping, and that your Pimmit Hills split-level's finished basement demands thorough treatment to prevent mold in hidden spaces.`
    ],
    localContext: "Falls Church's diverse housing stock—from 1920s craftsman bungalows to 1960s colonials to Lake Barcroft waterfront homes—requires restoration expertise most companies simply don't have. We've protected irreplaceable features in historic homes throughout Falls Church City, Seven Corners, and Lake Barcroft since 2005."

      question: "How quickly should I call after discovering water damage in my Falls Church home?",
      answer: "Immediately. Water damage worsens exponentially—mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours, and water continues migrating into wall cavities, under floors, and through framing. In Falls Church's older homes with balloon framing, a few hours of delay can mean water spreading to entirely different floors. Call (703) 656-0111 the moment you discover water."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save my original hardwood floors after water damage?",
      answer: "Often, yes. Falls Church's older homes frequently feature high-quality hardwood that responds well to professional drying. The key is rapid response and controlled drying—slow, steady moisture removal prevents the warping and cupping that destroys irreplaceable flooring. We've saved original hardwood from the 1920s through the 1960s throughout Falls Church City and Seven Corners."
    },
    {
      question: "Will drying damage my plaster walls?",
      answer: "Not with proper techniques. Aggressive drying with high heat and velocity can crack and delaminate plaster. We use controlled drying protocols—lower air velocity, graduated humidity reduction, and appropriate timelines—that remove moisture while protecting your historic plaster. This is a specialty for Falls Church's older homes."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work directly with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We handle direct billing with all major carriers and provide the detailed documentation insurance adjusters require. Our estimates, moisture readings, daily logs, and photo documentation support your claim. Many Falls Church homeowners find that professional documentation actually improves their claim outcomes."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent mold after water damage?",
      answer: "Thorough drying within 24-48 hours prevents most mold growth. We use industrial dehumidifiers and air movers to reduce moisture to safe levels, then verify with both pinless meters and thermal imaging. For Falls Church's older homes, this often takes 4-7 days of monitored drying—rushing the process invites mold problems later."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between your service and national chains?",
      answer: "We're locally owned and Falls Church-focused. Our crews know the neighborhoods, understand historic home construction, and are positioned for 30-minute response. National franchises often dispatch from distant locations and lack expertise in Falls Church's specific challenges—aging infrastructure, historic materials, and diverse housing stock."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you service Lake Barcroft waterfront properties?",
      answer: "Yes. Lake Barcroft's waterfront homes are a specialty. These properties face unique challenges—high water tables, walkout basement exposure, and proximity to the lake. We understand the specific moisture dynamics of waterfront properties and tailor our approach accordingly."
