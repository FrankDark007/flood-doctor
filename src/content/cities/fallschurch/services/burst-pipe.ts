    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe in Falls Church can release hundreds of gallons of water per hour into your home. In the time it takes you to find the main shutoff—if you can find it in an older home's basement—water has already soaked through floors, migrated into wall cavities, and begun damaging the structure. Falls Church's 1920s-1960s housing stock presents particular risks: original galvanized pipes that have corroded for decades, copper supply lines with aging joints, and plumbing routed through unheated crawlspaces and exterior walls.

Flood Doctor responds to Falls Church burst pipe emergencies within 30 minutes. We've extracted water from 1940s bungalows in Falls Church City where a supply line burst in a second-floor bathroom and flooded down to the basement. We've dried Seven Corners colonials where a frozen pipe split in an exterior wall. We've restored Lake Barcroft homes where decades-old galvanized lines finally gave way. When pipes burst in Falls Church, we're already on the way.`,

      `Falls Church homes face burst pipe risks that newer construction doesn't share. The original plumbing in many pre-1970s homes includes galvanized steel pipes that corrode internally, narrowing over time until joints weaken and fail. Water hammer from aging valves stresses pipe connections. And winter freezing—even in Northern Virginia's relatively mild climate—threatens supply lines in unheated spaces: crawlspaces, exterior walls, and poorly insulated garages.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand Falls Church's plumbing challenges. We work quickly to extract water, protect your home's historic features, and begin the drying process that prevents mold and structural damage. We also document everything for insurance—burst pipe damage is typically covered, and proper documentation ensures your claim is processed efficiently.`
    ],
    localContext: "Falls Church's aging housing stock means many homes still have original 50-80 year old plumbing. Galvanized pipes, old copper joints, and outdated shutoff valves create burst pipe risks that require specialized response."

Most Falls Church homeowners file insurance claims for burst pipe damage.",

      question: "I found a burst pipe—what should I do first?",
      answer: "Shut off the main water supply immediately. In older Falls Church homes, the shutoff is typically in the basement near where the water line enters. If you can't find it, call us anyway—we'll locate and close it when we arrive. Then call (703) 656-0111 for emergency response."
    },
    {
      question: "How long can a burst pipe run before causing serious damage?",
      answer: "Serious damage begins within minutes. A typical supply line releases 5-8 gallons per minute—that's 300+ gallons per hour flooding into your home. Even 10 minutes of uncontrolled flow can soak through floors and into wall cavities. This is why shutoff speed matters."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover burst pipe damage?",
      answer: "Typically yes. Burst pipes are usually a covered peril under standard homeowners insurance. We document the pipe failure, the water damage extent, and our restoration process thoroughly for your claim. We also handle direct billing with most carriers."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you dry water inside walls after a burst pipe?",
      answer: "We use Injectidry systems that force warm, dry air into wall cavities through small ports. Combined with thermal imaging to verify drying progress, we can dry most wall spaces without removing drywall—preserving your Falls Church home's finishes and reducing restoration costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call a plumber or restoration company first?",
      answer: "Call us first if there's active flooding. We respond in 30 minutes to stop damage from spreading and begin extraction. A plumber repairs the pipe, but doesn't remove water or dry your home. We can help coordinate with a trusted plumber after the emergency is controlled."
    },
    {
      question: "My pipes are old—should I replace them before they burst?",
      answer: "That's a question for a plumber, but we can share what we see. Falls Church homes with original galvanized pipes (pre-1960s) are higher risk. If you've had small leaks, discolored water, or reduced water pressure, those are warning signs. Proactive repiping is much cheaper than burst pipe damage restoration."
