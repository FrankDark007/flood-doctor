    paragraphs: [
      `Mold in your Falls Church home isn't just an aesthetic problem—it's a health concern and a threat to your property's structure and value. Whether you've discovered mold after water damage, found it growing in a humid basement, or smell that telltale musty odor without a visible source, professional remediation protects your family and your investment. Falls Church's older housing stock and humid summers create conditions where mold thrives if given any opportunity.

Flood Doctor has remediated mold throughout Falls Church since 2005. We've removed mold from 1940s bungalows in Falls Church City where decades of basement humidity created hidden growth. We've treated Seven Corners colonials where a slow leak fed mold colonies inside wall cavities. We've addressed Lake Barcroft waterfront homes where high water tables create persistent moisture challenges. Our IICRC-certified crews follow industry protocols for safe, effective mold removal.`,

      `Falls Church homes present unique mold challenges. The older housing stock includes construction features—balloon framing, minimal vapor barriers, original windows—that allow moisture intrusion modern homes don't face. Lake Barcroft's waterfront properties contend with humidity levels that stay elevated year-round. Basement spaces throughout Falls Church often lack adequate ventilation, creating conditions where mold grows on any organic material.

Our remediation process addresses both the mold and the moisture source. Removing visible mold without fixing the underlying moisture problem just invites regrowth. We identify where moisture is coming from, remediate existing mold safely, and help you prevent future problems. This comprehensive approach protects your Falls Church home long-term.`

    localContext: "Falls Church's humid summers, older housing stock, and areas with high water tables create ideal mold conditions. We've addressed mold problems throughout Falls Church City, Seven Corners, Lake Barcroft, and surrounding neighborhoods since 2005."

We treat non-porous surfaces with antimicrobial agents. In Falls Church's older homes, we take care to identify and address mold in balloon-framed wall cavities.",

      {
        title: "Basement Humidity in Older Homes",
        description: "Many Falls Church basements—especially in homes built before the 1970s—lack modern waterproofing and adequate ventilation. These spaces maintain humidity levels above 60% during summer months, creating ideal mold conditions on joists, stored materials, and any organic surfaces.",
        solution: "We remediate existing mold and install commercial dehumidifiers sized for your basement. Ongoing humidity control prevents regrowth and protects against future mold development."

        title: "Lake Barcroft Waterfront Moisture",
        description: "Waterfront and near-waterfront properties around Lake Barcroft face persistent elevated humidity from proximity to the water. Walkout basements, lower levels, and even main floors can maintain humidity levels that support mold growth.",
        solution: "Lake Barcroft remediation includes specialized moisture management planning. We recommend whole-home dehumidification and ventilation improvements tailored to waterfront property challenges."
      },
      {
        title: "Hidden Mold in Balloon-Framed Walls",
        description: "Pre-1940s Falls Church homes often use balloon framing where wall cavities run from foundation to attic. Water intrusion at any level can travel through these open channels, creating hidden mold colonies that aren't visible from either inside or outside the wall.",
        solution: "We use thermal imaging and invasive testing to identify mold in balloon-framed cavities. Remediation may require opening walls at multiple levels to access hidden growth and treat the full extent of contamination."

      {
        title: "Post-Water-Damage Mold Growth",
        description: "Falls Church homeowners who experienced water damage—flooding, burst pipes, roof leaks—sometimes discover mold weeks or months later. Inadequate drying after water events leaves moisture in wall cavities and subfloor spaces where mold develops invisibly.",
        solution: "We trace mold growth back to its moisture source, even if that source has since dried. Complete remediation includes addressing all affected areas, not just where mold is currently visible."
      },
      {
        title: "HVAC System Mold Contamination",
        description: "Aging HVAC systems in Falls Church homes can develop mold in ductwork, on evaporator coils, and in drip pans. The system then distributes mold spores throughout the home every time it runs, affecting air quality even without visible mold.",
        solution: "We assess HVAC systems as part of comprehensive mold inspections. Duct cleaning, coil treatment, and improved drainage address HVAC-related mold. We work with local HVAC contractors when system repairs are needed."

    {
      question: "How do I know if I have a mold problem?",
      answer: "Warning signs include visible mold growth (black, green, or white patches), musty odors, unexplained allergy symptoms, and recent water damage. In Falls Church's older homes, mold often grows in concealed spaces before becoming visible. If you suspect mold, call for a professional inspection."
    },
    {
      question: "Is mold dangerous to my family's health?",
      answer: "Mold exposure can cause respiratory symptoms, allergic reactions, and aggravate asthma. Some individuals are more sensitive than others. Black mold (Stachybotrys) produces mycotoxins with more serious health implications. Regardless of mold type, professional remediation protects your family."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I remove mold myself?",
      answer: "Small mold patches (under 10 square feet) on non-porous surfaces can sometimes be addressed with proper safety precautions. Larger areas, mold on porous materials, mold in concealed spaces, or any black mold should be professionally remediated. DIY attempts at larger mold problems often spread contamination."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold come back after remediation?",
      answer: "Not if the moisture source is corrected. Mold requires moisture to grow—eliminate the moisture and you eliminate the mold risk. Our remediation includes identifying and addressing moisture sources, plus recommendations for ongoing humidity control."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover mold remediation?",
      answer: "Coverage depends on the cause. Mold resulting from a covered water damage event (like a burst pipe) is often covered. Mold from maintenance issues, humidity, or ongoing leaks typically isn't covered. We document the cause thoroughly to support claims for covered situations."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does mold remediation take?",
      answer: "Small, contained mold problems may take 1-2 days. Larger contaminations, mold in multiple areas, or concealed mold in wall cavities may require 3-5 days. We provide timeline estimates during inspection and keep you informed throughout the process."
