    paragraphs: [
      `When floodwaters enter your Falls Church home—whether from summer storms, creek overflow, or groundwater saturation—you need cleanup that goes far beyond pumping water. Flood water carries contaminants: mud, bacteria, sewage, lawn chemicals, and debris that coat every surface it touches. Your Falls Church City bungalow, Seven Corners colonial, or Lake Barcroft waterfront home requires thorough cleaning, disinfection, and professional drying to be safe for your family again.

Flood Doctor has handled flood cleanup throughout Falls Church since 2005. We've responded to major storm flooding in Baileys Crossroads when drainage systems overwhelmed. We've cleaned Lake Barcroft homes after lake levels rose into walkout basements. We've restored Falls Church City properties after flash flooding from sudden summer storms. This is different from burst pipe cleanup—flood water is contaminated water that requires biohazard protocols.`,

      `Falls Church faces flood risks that vary by neighborhood. Lake Barcroft waterfront properties are vulnerable to lake level fluctuations during heavy rain seasons. Low-lying areas in Baileys Crossroads and Seven Corners collect runoff when legacy storm drains can't handle intense rainfall. Even properties on higher ground can flood when groundwater saturation pushes water up through basement floors.

Our IICRC-certified flood cleanup teams understand these differences. We bring commercial extraction equipment, antimicrobial treatments, and industrial drying capacity to every Falls Church flood emergency. We remove contaminated materials safely, treat affected surfaces properly, and dry your home thoroughly. We also handle flood insurance claims—documentation is critical for flood damage, and we provide what adjusters need.`

    localContext: "Falls Church's varied topography—from Lake Barcroft shoreline to hillside neighborhoods—creates different flood patterns throughout the area. We've cleaned flood damage from every type of flooding Falls Church experiences."

    {
      question: "Is flood water cleanup different from regular water damage restoration?",
      answer: "Yes, significantly. Flood water (Category 3) is contaminated with bacteria, sewage, chemicals, and debris. Porous materials like carpet and drywall can't be saved—they must be removed. All surfaces require antimicrobial treatment. We follow IICRC protocols for contaminated water that go far beyond clean water restoration."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my homeowner's insurance cover flood damage?",
      answer: "Standard homeowners insurance typically doesn't cover natural flooding—that requires separate flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or private flood insurance. However, some flooding scenarios (like sewer backup) may be covered under homeowners policies. We help you understand which policy applies to your situation."
    },
    {
      question: "How soon do you need to respond to flooding?",
      answer: "Immediately. Bacteria in flood water multiply rapidly—contamination worsens significantly after 24-48 hours. The longer flood water sits, the more materials require removal and the greater the health risks. Fast response is critical for both cost control and safety."
    },
    {
      question: "What materials will need to be removed after flooding?",
      answer: "Porous materials below the flood line typically require removal: carpet, carpet pad, drywall (usually 12-24 inches above flood level), insulation, and particleboard. Solid materials like framing, concrete, and subfloor can often be cleaned, treated, and dried rather than replaced."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stay in my home during flood cleanup?",
      answer: "It depends on the extent of flooding and contamination. Minor flooding in one area may allow occupancy in other parts of the home. Significant flooding—especially with sewage contamination—typically requires temporary relocation until cleanup and drying are complete."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle the reconstruction after flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Yes. After flood cleanup and drying, many Falls Church homeowners continue with our reconstruction services. We replace drywall, flooring, and other materials removed during cleanup. Working with the same company through the entire process ensures consistent quality and simpler insurance claims."
