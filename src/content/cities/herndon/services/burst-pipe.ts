    headline: "Emergency Burst Pipe Response for Herndon Properties",
    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe releases 400-600 gallons of water per hour into your Herndon property. Within the time it takes to drive home from Tysons or Reston, a failed supply line can flood your entire lower level. The home office where you work remotely, the recreation room where your kids play, the guest suite you finished last year—all underwater because of a quarter-inch crack in a copper line.

Flood Doctor has responded to burst pipe emergencies throughout Herndon for nearly two decades. We've extracted water from Fox Mill colonials at 3 AM, dried the finished basements of Worldgate townhomes after supply line failures, and restored Franklin Farm properties following winter freeze damage. When pipe failures strike Herndon—and they strike every winter—our crews are positioned within minutes of your door.`,

      `Herndon's pipe failures follow predictable patterns. Winter freezes catch exterior hose bibs, attic supply lines, and pipes in unconditioned spaces. Summer brings pressurized supply line failures, often inside wall cavities where they flood for hours before detection. Older Fox Mill and Downtown Herndon properties—built when copper was standard—experience corrosion failures that modern PEX systems avoid.

We coordinate water shutoff, extract standing water, and begin drying before a plumber even arrives. Time matters: every hour of delay means thousands more in damage to your property.`

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "What should I do first when a pipe bursts in my Herndon home?",
      answer: "Shut off the main water supply immediately—this stops water flow while you call for help. If you can't find the shutoff or it's stuck, call us at (703) 656-0108 anyway—we can guide you and are dispatching simultaneously. Turn off electricity to affected areas if water is near outlets or panels."
    },
    {
      question: "How much water damage can a burst pipe cause?",
      answer: "A typical supply line releases 400-600 gallons per hour. In the time it takes to drive home from work, a burst pipe can release 2,000+ gallons into your Herndon home. Water then migrates through floors, down walls, and into areas far from the original break. Fast shutoff and immediate response are critical."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do pipes burst in winter?",
      answer: "Water expands when it freezes, creating pressure that bursts pipes. Herndon homes with attic plumbing, exterior wall lines, and unconditioned spaces are especially vulnerable. Pipes can burst during the freeze or when they thaw—either way, fast response limits damage."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call a plumber or water damage company first?",
      answer: "Call us first—we respond faster, can begin extraction while the plumber repairs, and coordinate the entire process. We have relationships with Herndon plumbers and can recommend reliable emergency plumbing if needed. Our goal is getting water out before it spreads further."
    },
    {
      question: "Will insurance cover burst pipe damage?",
      answer: "Yes, most homeowner policies cover sudden pipe failures and resulting water damage. Gradual leaks from maintenance neglect may have limitations. We document everything for your claim, photograph damage, log moisture readings, and provide the detailed reports adjusters need."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you prevent mold after a burst pipe?",
      answer: "With fast response and proper drying, yes. Mold needs 24-48 hours of moisture to begin growing. We extract water immediately, deploy industrial drying equipment, and monitor moisture levels until materials return to normal. Our thorough approach prevents the mold problems that follow inadequate restoration."
