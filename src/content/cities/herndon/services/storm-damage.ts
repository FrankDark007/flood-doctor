    paragraphs: [
      `When severe weather crosses Fairfax County, Herndon's mature trees become liabilities. The stately oaks that shade your Fox Mill colonial can drop limbs through roofs, crash into fences, or topple onto cars parked in driveways. Add wind-driven rain, hail damage, and overwhelmed storm drainage, and a single storm can create multiple damage types across your property.

Flood Doctor responds to storm damage throughout Herndon within 30 minutes of safe travel conditions. We've tarped roofs in Fox Mill during active weather, extracted storm water from Downtown Herndon basements, and coordinated tree removal with restoration at Franklin Farm properties. Storm damage requires rapid response to prevent secondary water damage—every hour a compromised roof leaks, restoration costs climb.`,

      `Herndon's storm damage reflects its housing mix. Fox Mill's colonials face mature tree exposure across large lots. Downtown Herndon's historic properties have aging roofing and infrastructure vulnerable to wind. The townhome communities in Worldgate and Franklin Farm present shared roof and siding concerns where storm damage can affect multiple units.

We coordinate all aspects of storm restoration: emergency tarping, water extraction, structural drying, debris removal coordination, and insurance documentation. One call handles everything—from the moment the storm passes until your property is restored.`

    localContext: "Herndon's combination of mature trees in established neighborhoods and concentrated townhome communities creates varied storm damage scenarios. A single event can damage multiple roof sections, flood basements, and require coordination across property types."

      question: "When should I call after storm damage?",
      answer: "Call immediately once it's safe. Even if you're not sure about damage extent, early assessment and emergency tarping prevent secondary water damage. We respond to Herndon calls within 30 minutes of safe travel conditions—often while rain is still falling."
    },
    {
      question: "A tree fell on my Herndon home. What do I do?",
      answer: "Evacuate if structural integrity is questionable, then call us. We assess safety, coordinate tree removal, provide emergency weatherproofing, and handle resulting water and structural damage. Don't attempt to move tree limbs yourself—shifting weight can cause additional collapse."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I call my insurance company or you first?",
      answer: "Call us first—we can begin emergency services and documentation immediately. Notify your insurance company soon after, but don't wait for their approval before emergency weatherproofing. Preventing additional damage protects your claim and your property."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have hidden storm damage?",
      answer: "After storms, inspect attics for daylight (indicating roof damage), check basements for water entry, look for ceiling stains or wet walls, and examine exterior siding. However, much storm damage isn't visible to homeowners. Professional assessment catches damage you might miss."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We document all damage, photograph before and after conditions, provide detailed scope reports, and work directly with adjusters. Professional documentation typically supports better claim outcomes than homeowner-only documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if another storm comes before repairs are complete?",
      answer: "Our emergency tarping and board-up services provide weatherproofing until permanent repairs occur. We use quality materials designed to withstand additional weather. If another storm causes additional damage to temporarily protected areas, we address it promptly."
