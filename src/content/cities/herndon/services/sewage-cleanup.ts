    paragraphs: [
      `Few emergencies create more urgent health hazards than sewage backup. When raw sewage floods into your Herndon basement through floor drains, backing up from overtaxed sewer lines or aging infrastructure, every minute of exposure increases contamination spread. Your finished basement—the home office, recreation room, guest quarters you use daily—now sits in Category 3 biohazardous waste.

Flood Doctor maintains biohazard certification specifically for these emergencies. We've cleaned up sewage backups throughout Herndon: storm-overwhelmed sewer lines in established neighborhoods, tree root blockages in Fox Mill's mature streets, and drain backup disasters in Worldgate townhomes. When sewage invades your property, we arrive with the PPE, antimicrobial treatments, and disposal protocols the situation demands.`,

      `Herndon faces varied sewage risks across its neighborhoods. Older areas like Fox Mill and Downtown Herndon have mature trees whose roots infiltrate aging sewer lines, creating blockages that cause backup during storms. The townhome communities in Worldgate and Franklin Farm share sewer infrastructure that can be overwhelmed during heavy usage. Even newer developments can experience backup when main lines are blocked.

Our crews don't approach sewage like regular water damage. This is biohazard work requiring specialized training, protective equipment, and disposal procedures that ensure your family's safety.`

    localContext: "Herndon's mix of established neighborhoods with mature trees and newer townhome communities creates varied sewage risks. Tree root intrusion affects older areas while shared infrastructure can affect townhome communities. Both require immediate professional response."

      question: "Is sewage backup dangerous to my family?",
      answer: "Yes—sewage contains bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause serious illness. Do not enter contaminated areas, don't attempt cleanup yourself, and keep children and pets away. Call professionals immediately. The longer sewage sits, the more dangerous it becomes and the further contamination spreads."
    },
    {
      question: "What gets thrown away after sewage backup?",
      answer: "Porous materials that absorbed sewage must be disposed of as biohazard waste: carpet, padding, drywall below the contamination line, upholstered furniture, mattresses, and similar items. Hard surfaces like tile, concrete, and sealed wood can often be decontaminated and saved."
    },
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover sewage backup?",
      answer: "Most homeowner policies offer sewer backup coverage, either included or as an endorsement. Check your policy or call your agent. We document everything for claims, photograph damage, and provide detailed reports. If you're unsure about coverage, we can help you understand your policy."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until my basement is safe after sewage cleanup?",
      answer: "Proper decontamination takes 5-7 days: extraction, material removal, antimicrobial treatment, drying, and verification. We don't declare spaces safe until treatment is complete and verified. For Herndon families with health-sensitive members, this thoroughness matters."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes sewer line backups in Herndon?",
      answer: "Herndon's mature trees—especially in Fox Mill and Downtown—send roots into aging sewer lines. Heavy storms can overwhelm system capacity. Older properties may have deteriorating pipes. We recommend camera inspection after backup to identify the cause and prevent recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "Can backup affect multiple townhome units?",
      answer: "Yes. Herndon's townhome communities share sewer infrastructure. Blockages or failures can affect multiple units simultaneously. We coordinate with HOAs and property managers when multiple homes need attention, ensuring complete decontamination throughout affected areas."
