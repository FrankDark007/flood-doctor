    paragraphs: [
      `That musty smell in your Herndon basement isn't just unpleasant—it's a warning sign of mold growth that may have spread far beyond what you can see. Herndon's homes, with their finished basements, extensive HVAC systems, and varying construction ages, create environments where mold thrives hidden from view. By the time you notice the smell or see discoloration, colonies have often established throughout wall cavities and under flooring.

Flood Doctor's IICRC-certified mold remediation technicians have cleared mold from Herndon properties for nearly two decades. We've remediated hidden growth in Fox Mill basements, eliminated mold colonies behind the walls of Downtown Herndon historic homes, and restored healthy air quality in Worldgate townhomes where previous water damage went unaddressed. Mold doesn't respect property values—your family home is vulnerable.`,

      `Herndon's mold challenges stem from its housing characteristics. Clay soil creates high water tables that increase basement humidity. The mix of older Fox Mill colonials and newer townhome construction means varied ventilation patterns. Finished basements with poor air circulation trap moisture. HVAC systems spread spores throughout entire homes before anyone notices the source.

We don't simply spray bleach and hope for the best. Professional mold remediation requires containment, HEPA filtration, source elimination, surface treatment, and verification testing. For Herndon families with health concerns, real estate transactions pending, or visible mold growth, proper remediation protects both health and property value.`

    localContext: "Herndon's combination of finished basements, varied construction ages, and active real estate market demands thorough mold remediation. Incomplete work shows up in home inspections, affects resale, and puts families at risk."

    factors: [
      "Square footage of affected area—larger colonization requires more extensive work",
      "Material types—finished spaces affect removal approach",
      "Accessibility—mold behind finished walls requires more demolition",

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have a mold problem in my Herndon home?",
      answer: "Warning signs include musty odors, visible discoloration on walls or ceilings, water stains, condensation on windows, and unexplained respiratory symptoms that improve when you're away from home. Herndon's finished basements often hide mold behind walls—if you had water damage that wasn't professionally dried, mold may have developed unseen."
    },
    {
      question: "Is black mold dangerous?",
      answer: "Stachybotrys ('black mold') produces mycotoxins and requires careful remediation with full containment. However, mold color doesn't determine danger—many dark molds are harmless while some lighter species are problematic. Professional testing identifies species. Regardless of type, visible mold in your home should be remediated."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I clean mold myself?",
      answer: "Small areas (under 10 square feet) of surface mold on non-porous materials can sometimes be cleaned by homeowners. However, mold in wall cavities, HVAC systems, or porous materials requires professional remediation. Improper cleaning spreads spores throughout your Herndon home. When in doubt, get professional assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold come back after remediation?",
      answer: "Not if the moisture source is corrected. Mold requires moisture to grow—eliminate the water problem and mold won't return. Our remediation includes moisture source identification. For Herndon basements with chronic humidity, this may involve dehumidification systems or waterproofing improvements."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does mold remediation take?",
      answer: "Most residential projects take 3-7 days depending on scope. Larger homes with extensive growth may take longer. Testing results take 2-3 additional days. We provide realistic timelines after assessment—thorough remediation takes time but protects your family and property value."
    },
    {
      question: "Will mold remediation affect my home's resale value?",
      answer: "Proper remediation with third-party clearance testing actually protects value. Undisclosed or improperly treated mold creates liability and negotiation leverage for buyers. Many Herndon real estate transactions include mold inspection—having documented professional remediation with clearance certification is far better than visible problems."
