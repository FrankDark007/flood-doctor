    paragraphs: [
      `After firefighters leave your Herndon property, the real restoration challenge begins. The fire may be out, but smoke has penetrated every room, soot coats surfaces far from the flames, and water from suppression efforts saturates floors and walls. Your home—with its finished basement, home office, and family spaces—now requires specialized restoration that most companies aren't equipped to provide.

Flood Doctor has restored fire-damaged properties throughout Herndon for nearly two decades. We've removed soot from Fox Mill kitchens, eliminated smoke odor from Downtown Herndon historic homes, and dried fire suppression water from Worldgate townhome basements. Fire damage restoration combines smoke and soot cleaning, odor elimination, water damage restoration, and content cleaning—we handle all of it.`,

      `Herndon's varied housing stock presents unique fire restoration challenges. Fox Mill colonials have larger square footage for smoke absorption. Downtown Herndon historic homes have original materials requiring specialized cleaning. Townhome communities in Worldgate and Franklin Farm have shared walls where smoke can migrate between units. HVAC systems spread smoke throughout entire properties before fires are even extinguished.

We respond within hours of fire department clearance, beginning the restoration process while damage is still fresh. Early intervention saves more of your property—soot continues etching surfaces and smoke odor sets deeper every day.`

    localContext: "Herndon's range of property types—from historic downtown homes to modern townhome communities—requires fire restoration expertise that addresses varied construction methods and materials."

      question: "When can you start fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "We respond within hours of fire department clearance. The fire department must release the property first—usually after investigation. Call us as soon as the fire is out; we'll coordinate timing and arrive as soon as we're permitted access."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is fast response important after a fire?",
      answer: "Soot is acidic and continues etching surfaces every day. Smoke odor sets deeper into porous materials over time. Water from suppression efforts can cause mold growth within 24-48 hours. Early intervention saves more of your Herndon property and reduces overall restoration costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can smoke odor really be eliminated?",
      answer: "Yes, with professional treatment. We use thermal fogging, hydroxyl generators, and ozone treatments to eliminate odor at the molecular level—not just mask it. For homes with extensive smoke exposure, this process is essential. DIY approaches typically fail."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my personal belongings after a fire?",
      answer: "We inventory, clean, and restore salvageable items. Electronics receive specialized cleaning, fabrics are ozone-treated, hard items are ultrasonically cleaned. Items that can't be restored are documented for insurance. Your belongings receive individual attention."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover fire damage restoration?",
      answer: "Yes—fire damage is a standard covered peril in homeowner's policies. We work directly with insurance adjusters, document all damage and restoration efforts, and support your claim throughout the process. Professional documentation typically results in more complete coverage."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does fire restoration take?",
      answer: "Timelines vary dramatically. A contained fire with limited smoke might take 1-2 weeks. Significant fires requiring demolition and reconstruction can take months. We provide realistic timelines after assessment and keep you informed throughout the process."
