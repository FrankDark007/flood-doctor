      `When water infiltrates your Herndon property, the stakes are significant whether you're a homeowner or business owner. Your Fox Mill colonial's finished basement isn't just storage—it's a recreation room, home office, or guest suite. Your Downtown Herndon commercial space isn't just square footage—it's your livelihood.

Flood Doctor has restored water-damaged properties throughout Herndon for nearly two decades. We've extracted standing water from Franklin Farm family homes, dried the finished basements of Fox Mill families, and protected commercial operations in the Dulles tech corridor. When your Worldgate neighbor or business associate recommends a restoration company, they mention us—because we've already served their community.`,

      `Herndon's water damage challenges span both residential and commercial sectors. The clay soil beneath established neighborhoods shifts during wet seasons, creating foundation cracks. Commercial buildings with extensive plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire suppression can release thousands of gallons when systems fail. The mature oaks in Fox Mill and Downtown Herndon—the same trees that provide neighborhood character—send roots into aging sewer lines.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers don't just pump water and leave. We understand that your McNair property requires precision drying to protect finished spaces, that your Downtown Herndon commercial lease has uptime requirements, and that your Worldgate townhome's open floor plan means water travels quickly between levels.`

    localContext: "Herndon's mix of established residential neighborhoods and commercial tech corridor requires restoration expertise that spans both sectors. We've protected homes in Fox Mill, businesses near Dulles, and everything in between since 2005."

      question: "How quickly should I call after discovering water damage in my Herndon property?",
      answer: "Immediately. Water damage worsens exponentially—mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours, and water continues migrating into wall cavities, under floors, and through ceiling spaces. Whether you're in a Fox Mill home or Downtown Herndon commercial space, a few hours of delay can mean thousands of additional dollars in damage. Call (703) 656-0108 the moment you discover water."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you save my hardwood floors after water damage?",
      answer: "Often, yes. Quality hardwood responds well to professional drying. The key is rapid response and controlled drying—slow, steady moisture removal prevents the warping and cupping that destroys flooring. We've saved flooring in Fox Mill colonials, Downtown Herndon properties, and townhomes throughout Worldgate."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle commercial water damage in Herndon?",
      answer: "Yes. Herndon's position in the Dulles tech corridor means we regularly respond to commercial facilities—from small offices on Elden Street to large facilities near the airport. We understand that commercial water damage involves business interruption concerns beyond just property damage."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work directly with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We handle direct billing with all major carriers and provide the detailed documentation insurance adjusters require. Our estimates, moisture readings, daily logs, and photo documentation support your claim. Professional documentation typically improves claim outcomes."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent mold after water damage?",
      answer: "Thorough drying within 24-48 hours prevents most mold growth. We use industrial dehumidifiers and air movers to reduce moisture to safe levels, then verify with both pinless meters and thermal imaging. For Herndon properties, this often takes 4-7 days of monitored drying—rushing the process invites mold problems later."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between your service and national chains?",
      answer: "We're locally focused and positioned in the Herndon area. Our crews know the neighborhoods, understand both residential and commercial construction, and are positioned for 30-minute response. National franchises often dispatch from distant locations and lack expertise in Herndon's specific challenges."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with water damage in a multi-unit building?",
      answer: "Yes. Herndon's many townhome communities and commercial buildings often require coordination when water affects multiple units. We work with HOAs, property managers, and building owners to ensure complete restoration across all affected spaces."
