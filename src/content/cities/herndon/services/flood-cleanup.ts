    headline: "Professional Flood Cleanup for Herndon Properties",
    paragraphs: [
      `Summer storms roll through Northern Virginia with little warning. One moment your Herndon property is peaceful; an hour later, several inches of rain has overwhelmed storm drains, breached window wells, and sent muddy water cascading into your finished basement. Your home office, recreation room, and guest quarters—spaces you use every day—now sit under brown water.

Flood Doctor has cleaned up after every major storm event in Herndon since 2005. We've pumped out Fox Mill colonials after flash floods, extracted storm water from Worldgate townhomes, and restored Franklin Farm properties after summer deluges. When NOAA issues a flash flood warning for Fairfax County, our phones light up with Herndon addresses—and our trucks are already positioned to respond.`,

      `Flood cleanup differs from typical water damage. Storm water carries soil, debris, and contaminants that complicate restoration. The clay-laden runoff from Herndon's terrain deposits sediment in carpet fibers, flooring seams, and HVAC systems. Flash floods overwhelm sump pumps, breach foundation walls, and create contamination categories that require specialized protocols.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand Herndon's flood patterns: the low-lying sections of certain neighborhoods, the window well vulnerabilities in older Fox Mill properties, the overwhelmed storm drains during intense rainfall. We don't just pump and leave—we extract, decontaminate, and restore.`
    ],
    localContext: "Herndon's topography creates varied flood risks. Properties in lower elevations, homes near creek tributaries, and older neighborhoods with aging storm drainage face higher flooding probability during severe storms."

  faqSection: [
    {
      question: "Should I wait until the storm passes to call for flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Call immediately, even during the storm. We dispatch when it's safe to travel—often before rain fully stops. Earlier calls mean earlier response times. Standing flood water continues damaging your Herndon home every hour it remains. Our crews know the area and can reach your property as soon as conditions allow."
    },
    {
      question: "Is flood water from a storm contaminated?",
      answer: "Almost always yes. Storm water picks up soil bacteria, lawn chemicals, animal waste, and debris as it flows. If it mixed with sewage backup—common during heavy storms—it's Category 3 biohazard. We assess contamination level and apply appropriate protocols. Don't wade through flood water without protection."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flood damage from a storm?",
      answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance typically covers storm damage, including water intrusion from overwhelmed drainage, window well flooding, and sump pump failure. Separate flood insurance is needed for rising water events. We document everything for your claim and work directly with adjusters."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does flood cleanup take in a Herndon home?",
      answer: "Initial water extraction takes hours; complete drying takes 5-10 days depending on affected area and materials. Herndon's finished basements require careful, monitored drying. Rushing creates mold problems later. We provide daily updates and realistic timelines."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my furniture and belongings be saved after flooding?",
      answer: "Many items can be cleaned and restored. We assess each item, separate salvageable from unsalvageable, and provide content cleaning services. Porous materials that absorbed contaminated water—like upholstered furniture in Category 3 flooding—typically require disposal for health reasons."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my home office equipment after flooding?",
      answer: "Electronics require careful handling. We protect equipment during extraction, maintain low humidity during drying, and recommend professional inspection before reconnecting power to any water-exposed devices. Your ability to work remotely depends on proper equipment restoration."
