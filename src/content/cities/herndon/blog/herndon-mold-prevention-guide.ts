    introduction: `Northern Virginia's humid climate creates ideal conditions for mold. Herndon homeowners must actively manage moisture—especially in basements, bathrooms, and other high-humidity areas—to prevent mold growth and protect indoor air quality.`,

    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Why Mold Thrives Here",
        content: `**Climate factors:**
- Summer humidity exceeds 70%
- Extended humid season (May-September)
- Moderate temperatures support growth
- Frequent rain adds moisture

**Home characteristics:**
- Basements (highest risk area)
- Limited ventilation in older homes
- HVAC may not adequately dehumidify
- Finished lower levels trap moisture`
      },
      {
        heading: "Humidity Control",
        content: `**Target levels:**
- Keep between 30-50%
- Never exceed 60% for extended periods
- Monitor with hygrometers

**Dehumidification:**
- Essential in basements
- Run continuously during humid months
- Size appropriately for space
- Empty or drain regularly

**Ventilation:**
- Exhaust fans during/after showers
- Vent dryers outside
- Use range hood when cooking
- Ensure exhausts vent outside`
      },
      {
        heading: "Problem Areas",
        content: `**Basements:**
- Run dehumidifier continuously
- Check for water intrusion
- Allow air circulation around storage
- Inspect monthly during humid season

**Bathrooms:**

      },
      {
        heading: "After Water Damage",
        content: `**The critical window:**
Mold can start in 24-48 hours after water exposure.

**Professional drying matters:**
- Industrial equipment dries faster

- Hidden moisture is addressed
- "Feels dry" isn't reliable

**If mold appears:**
- Don't disturb (spreads spores)
- Identify moisture source
- Small areas may be DIY cleanable
- Larger areas need professional help`
      },
      {
        heading: "When to Call Professionals",
