        content: `**Supply line failures:**
The most common cause:
- Under-sink connections
- Toilet supply lines
- Washing machine hoses
- Deteriorate with age
- Replace every 5-7 years

**Water heater failures:**
Tank units fail after 10-15 years:
- Release 40-80 gallons immediately
- Plus continuous flow until shutoff
- Many Herndon homes have aging units

**Basement flooding:**
Common during heavy storms:
- Sump pump failures
- Overwhelmed drainage
- Groundwater intrusion

**HVAC condensate:**
Clogged lines cause overflow:
- Common in humid months
- Often in attic or closet
- Damage spreads before discovery

**Plumbing system age:**
Established Herndon homes have aging plumbing:
- Copper pipes developing leaks
- Original supply lines failing
- Cast iron drains deteriorating`

        heading: "What NOT to Do",
        content: `Avoid these common mistakes:

**Don't use household fans:**
- Can spread moisture into walls
- Don't provide controlled drying

- Every hour increases scope
- Quick response limits damage

**Don't enter flood water:**
