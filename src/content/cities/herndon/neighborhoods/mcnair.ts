  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `McNair represents Herndon's evolution—established sections with mature landscaping alongside newer development, excellent schools drawing families from across the region, and a location convenient to the Dulles corridor employment centers. When water threatens properties in this diverse community, you need restoration experts who understand both the homes and the families who depend on them.

Flood Doctor has served McNair residents for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements in established sections after storms, dried the finished lower levels of newer homes after plumbing failures, and protected the home offices and recreation rooms that McNair families use daily. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from McNair, not in a distant warehouse—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—ranging from established colonials to newer luxury homes—requires versatile restoration expertise. Finished basements in McNair often serve as complete additional living levels with bedrooms, bathrooms, and family spaces. We treat each McNair property with the thoroughness these homes deserve.`,

      question: "How fast can you reach my McNair home?",
      answer: "We guarantee 15-minute response to McNair addresses. Our crews are positioned throughout the Herndon corridor, not at a distant warehouse. When you call about a flooded basement in McNair Farms or a burst pipe in an established section, we're already nearby."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have experience with both older and newer McNair homes?",
      answer: "Absolutely. McNair's mix of established 1990s construction and newer luxury homes each present different challenges. Older homes may have aging infrastructure; newer homes have complex systems. We handle both with appropriate expertise."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes water damage in McNair's newer homes?",
      answer: "Newer construction isn't immune to water damage. Supply line failures, appliance leaks, HVAC issues, and sump pump failures affect all ages of construction. Newer homes often have more complex plumbing with more potential failure points."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with my insurance company?",
      answer: "Yes. We handle direct billing, document everything for claims, and work with adjusters throughout the process. Professional documentation supports complete coverage for McNair's high-value finished basement claims."
