  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Fox Mill represents Herndon's established residential character—mature trees shading generous lots, well-maintained colonial homes, and a community that takes pride in property values. When water threatens these family investments, you need restoration experts who understand what's at stake.

Flood Doctor has served Fox Mill families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements during summer storms, dried finished lower levels after sump pump failures, and protected the character of colonials throughout the neighborhood. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Fox Mill, not in a distant warehouse—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—3,000 to 5,000+ square foot colonials on generous lots with mature landscaping—requires restoration expertise beyond typical residential work. Finished basements often include home offices, recreation rooms, and guest quarters. The mature trees that define the neighborhood can also send roots into aging sewer lines. We treat each Fox Mill property with the thoroughness these homes deserve.`,
