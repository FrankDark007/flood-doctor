  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Worldgate represents Herndon's vibrant mixed-use community—modern townhomes, condominiums, and the bustling Worldgate Centre with its restaurants, fitness centers, and retail. When water threatens properties in this concentrated development, you need restoration experts who understand both multi-unit residential challenges and commercial urgency.

Flood Doctor has served Worldgate residents and businesses for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from townhome basements after storms, dried commercial spaces in the Worldgate Centre, and coordinated multi-unit responses when water affects connected properties. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Worldgate, not in a distant warehouse—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—townhomes and condominiums with shared walls and common areas—requires restoration expertise beyond typical single-family work. Water events can affect multiple units. HOA coordination may be required. Shared systems complicate response. We treat each Worldgate property with the thoroughness this community deserves.`,
