  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Downtown Herndon represents the town's historic heart—charming storefronts along Elden Street, the restored Herndon Depot, tree-lined residential streets, and the W&OD Trail connecting it all. When water threatens properties in this distinctive area, you need restoration experts who understand both the historic character and the modern businesses that make downtown special.

Flood Doctor has served Downtown Herndon property owners for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements along Center Street, dried commercial spaces on Elden Street, and protected the unique character of historic homes near the Depot. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from downtown, not in a distant warehouse—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—ranging from historic homes over a century old to renovated townhomes and mixed-use buildings—requires restoration expertise beyond typical residential work. Original plaster walls, aging plumbing, and unique architectural details demand careful attention. We treat each Downtown Herndon property with the thoroughness its character deserves.`,
