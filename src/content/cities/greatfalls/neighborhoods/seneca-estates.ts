  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Seneca Estates represents Great Falls at its most exclusive—gated properties, contemporary architecture alongside traditional estates, and homes designed for families who expect privacy as much as luxury. When water threatens your Seneca Estates property, you need restoration experts who understand that discretion isn't a request—it's a requirement.

Flood Doctor has served Seneca Estates families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from contemporary great rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows, protected wine collections in temperature-controlled cellars, and dried finished lower levels in properties that set the standard for Great Falls luxury. Our unmarked vehicles and professional crews arrive within 30 minutes—neighbors never know we visited.

Seneca Estates' homes—ranging from 10,000 to 20,000+ square feet—feature the latest in smart home systems, wine storage, and custom climate control. Water damage threatens not just finishes but the integrated systems that make modern estates function. We understand both the traditional restoration work and the technology preservation these homes require.`,
