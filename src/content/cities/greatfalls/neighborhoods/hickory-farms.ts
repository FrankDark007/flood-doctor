  neighborhoodIntro: {
    paragraph: `Hickory Farms stands among Great Falls' most distinguished neighborhoods—custom estates on generous wooded lots, homes designed by noted architects, and properties containing art collections assembled over generations. When water threatens your Hickory Farms estate, you need restoration experts who understand that protecting a custom home means protecting irreplaceable craftsmanship and priceless collections.

Flood Doctor has served Hickory Farms families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from custom great rooms with museum-quality art, protected wine cellars during water emergencies, and dried finished lower levels containing home theaters and guest suites. Our crews arrive within 30 minutes—with the discretion and expertise Hickory Farms homeowners expect.

Hickory Farms' custom homes—architecturally significant properties averaging 8,000 to 15,000+ square feet—require restoration beyond standard residential work. Original millwork by master craftsmen, custom plaster finishes, imported materials specified by architects—these elements require specialized care during water damage restoration. We protect what makes your home irreplaceable.`,
