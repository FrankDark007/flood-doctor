    paragraphs: [
      `Great Falls basements aren't typical basement spaces. Your finished lower level might include a 3,000-bottle wine cellar, a home theater with $200,000 in electronics, a full guest suite, or an art gallery with pieces you've collected over decades. When water floods these spaces, you're not protecting drywall—you're protecting investments that may exceed the value of most homes.

Flood Doctor has extracted water from flooded basements throughout Great Falls for nearly two decades. We've saved wine collections in Forestville cellars, protected home theaters in Seneca Estates properties, and dried finished lower levels in manors along Georgetown Pike. When your estate's lower level floods at 2 AM, we respond within 30 minutes—with equipment scaled for the 5,000+ square foot spaces common in Great Falls.`,

      `The causes of basement flooding in Great Falls differ from typical suburban areas. Most properties operate on private well systems—when pressure tanks fail or pumps malfunction, water can flood your lower level before you realize there's a problem. Septic systems can back up, creating biohazard conditions that require specialized cleanup. The high water table near the Potomac creates persistent groundwater pressure against foundation walls, especially after heavy rains.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers understand these Great Falls-specific challenges. We don't just extract water—we identify why your basement flooded and help prevent recurrence while protecting the irreplaceable assets that make your lower level unique.`
    ],
    localContext: "Great Falls' finished lower levels often contain more value than typical entire homes—wine cellars, home theaters, art, guest suites. We provide the specialized protection these investments require, from climate-controlled drying for wine collections to asset relocation for fine art."

      question: "Can you protect my wine cellar during basement flooding cleanup?",
      answer: "Absolutely—wine cellar protection is essential for Great Falls basement work. We use climate-controlled drying methods that maintain appropriate temperature and humidity while extracting structural moisture. For valuable collections facing extended exposure, we coordinate with specialty wine storage facilities for temporary relocation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my basement flooded from septic backup?",
      answer: "Septic backups are Category 3 biohazard events requiring specialized protocols. We're certified for this level of contamination—our crews use appropriate protective equipment, antimicrobial treatments, and safe disposal methods. We coordinate with septic specialists for system repair while handling the contaminated cleanup."
    },
    {
      question: "My well system caused the flooding—do you work with well contractors?",

    },
    {
      question: "How do you dry a finished basement without damaging custom finishes?",
