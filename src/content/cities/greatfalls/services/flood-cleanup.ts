    paragraphs: [
      `Flooding in Great Falls takes forms that suburban areas never experience. Potomac River overflow threatens properties in the Riverbend corridor. Storm runoff on multi-acre estates can overwhelm drainage and flood lower levels, pool houses, and equestrian facilities. Groundwater pressure during wet seasons forces water through foundations that have stood for decades. When flooding strikes your Great Falls estate, you need restoration experts who understand these unique challenges.

Flood Doctor has handled flood emergencies throughout Great Falls for nearly two decades. We've extracted floodwater from manors along Georgetown Pike, dried equestrian facilities in Forestville, and restored finished lower levels in properties backing to Great Falls National Park. When flooding threatens your estate, we respond within 30 minutes—with equipment and expertise scaled for properties that may span 25,000 square feet across multiple structures.`,

      `Great Falls flood challenges compound in ways subdivision flooding doesn't. Your wine cellar may flood from groundwater intrusion during a wet spring. Your barn may take on water during summer storms. Your pool house may flood from storm drainage failures. Each scenario requires different cleanup approaches—and we're experienced in all of them.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers understand that flood cleanup in Great Falls means protecting assets that exist nowhere else. Your art collection, your wine cellar, your custom finishes, your equestrian equipment—all require specialized attention during flood restoration.`

    localContext: "Great Falls' Potomac River proximity, multi-acre estates, and mixed residential/agricultural properties create flood scenarios that standard restoration companies can't address. We bring the equipment, expertise, and discretion these situations require."

        description: "Flooded wine cellars face dual emergencies: structural water damage and climate disruption that threatens collections. Standard high-heat drying can damage wine as effectively as the flooding itself.",

    {
      question: "How quickly can you respond to flooding in Great Falls?",
      answer: "We guarantee 30-minute response to all Great Falls properties under normal conditions. During widespread flood events affecting multiple properties, we prioritize based on flood type and damage scope. Call (703) 656-0112 immediately—the sooner you call, the sooner we can respond."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you handle flooding in my barn and main house at the same time?",
      answer: "Yes. Great Falls estates often include multiple structures, and we bring capacity for simultaneous response. Our crews can work across your entire property—extracting water from your barn while drying your finished basement, protecting your wine cellar while addressing pool house flooding."
    },
    {
      question: "Is floodwater always contaminated?",
      answer: "Not always, but often. Groundwater intrusion from high water tables is typically Category 1 (clean water). Storm runoff and Potomac overflow are Category 2 or 3, containing debris and contamination. We assess water category immediately and apply appropriate protocols—contaminated flooding requires additional decontamination steps."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you protect my wine cellar during flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Wine cellar protection is essential for Great Falls properties. We use climate-controlled drying methods that maintain appropriate temperature and humidity ranges. For significant collections facing extended exposure, we coordinate with specialty wine storage facilities for temporary relocation."
    },
    {
      question: "What about my horses during barn flood cleanup?",
      answer: "Animal safety is a priority for equestrian facility work. We use products safe for animal environments, maintain ventilation requirements, and coordinate timing around your horses' needs. If temporary relocation is necessary, we work around your schedule for animal movement."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my insurance cover flood damage?",
      answer: "Standard homeowners policies often exclude flood damage. However, many Great Falls homeowners carry separate flood insurance or specialty policies. We handle direct billing with all carriers and provide the detailed documentation that supports claims. We can help you understand your coverage during our initial assessment."
