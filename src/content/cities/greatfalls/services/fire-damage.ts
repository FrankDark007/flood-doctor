      `Fire damage in a Great Falls estate creates devastation that extends far beyond the flames. The fire itself destroys what it touches—but smoke travels through every room of your 18,000-square-foot manor, coating surfaces with corrosive soot that continues damaging materials for weeks. The water firefighters use to extinguish the blaze soaks through floors and walls, creating secondary water damage throughout your property. Your wine cellar, your art collection, your irreplaceable antiques—all face threats from smoke, soot, and water even if flames never reached them.

Flood Doctor has restored fire-damaged estates throughout Great Falls for nearly two decades. We've removed smoke from Forestville manors, extracted firefighting water from Seneca Estates properties, and protected art collections in homes along Georgetown Pike. When fire threatens your estate, we respond with restoration expertise scaled for the largest properties—and specialized protocols for the irreplaceable assets Great Falls homes contain.`,

      `Great Falls fire damage challenges compound in ways suburban fires don't. Your estate may have 12,000 square feet affected by smoke while only 500 square feet touched by flame. Firefighting water can cascade through multiple floors to your finished basement, soaking wine cellars and home theaters. Soot particles—microscopic and corrosive—penetrate HVAC systems that spread damage throughout your property.

Our IICRC-certified fire restorers understand that Great Falls fire recovery means protecting what survived as urgently as addressing what burned. Your wine collection, your art, your custom millwork—all require immediate attention to prevent secondary damage from smoke, soot, and water.`

We clean all affected surfaces using appropriate methods for each material: different techniques for plaster versus millwork versus stone versus textiles. For Great Falls estates, this often means room-by-room specialized treatment.",

        title: "Art Collection Smoke Damage",
        description: "Smoke penetrates canvas, paper, and textiles—causing damage that worsens daily. Paintings, works on paper, tapestries, and antique textiles all face irreversible harm if not addressed immediately after a fire.",
        solution: "Art protection is immediate priority. We coordinate with professional art handlers for relocation, establish climate control for pieces that can't be moved, and document all damage for insurance. Stabilization happens before general restoration begins."
      },
      {
        title: "Wine Cellar Contamination",
        description: "Smoke can penetrate wine cellars even when fire doesn't. Soot deposits on bottles, smoke odor permeates corks, and climate disruption threatens collection integrity. Standard fire restoration approaches can make matters worse.",
        solution: "We assess wine cellar conditions immediately and stabilize climate when possible. For affected collections, we coordinate with wine specialists for professional cleaning or temporary storage. Your investment receives specialized attention."

        title: "Multi-Floor Firefighting Water",
        description: "Water used to fight fires on upper floors cascades through your estate—soaking ceiling cavities, running down walls, and pooling in finished basements. In large estates, water can travel great distances from the fire location.",
        solution: "We trace water migration throughout all levels using thermal imaging. Extraction and drying happen throughout the entire water path—not just beneath the fire area. Wine cellars, home theaters, and guest quarters all receive attention."
      },
      {
        title: "Custom Millwork & Plaster Restoration",
        description: "Great Falls estates feature irreplaceable millwork, hand-applied plaster, and custom finishes that standard restoration approaches can't address. Improper cleaning damages historical materials; poor matching during repair creates visible defects.",
        solution: "We work with specialty craftsmen who understand Great Falls' high-end construction. Our cleaning methods are appropriate for each material, and our restoration coordination includes artisans who can match original work."
      },
      {
        title: "HVAC Smoke Distribution",
        description: "Central HVAC systems in large estates can distribute smoke throughout 20,000+ square feet in minutes. Areas that seem unaffected by fire may have significant soot contamination from air circulation during the event.",
        solution: "We assess all areas served by HVAC, not just visibly damaged spaces. Air sampling identifies contamination levels throughout your estate, and HVAC cleaning prevents ongoing redistribution of particles."

      question: "How quickly can you respond after a fire in Great Falls?",
      answer: "We respond within 30 minutes of fire department clearance. Smoke and soot damage worsens hourly—the sooner we begin, the more we can save. Call (703) 656-0112 as soon as fire crews indicate the property is safe for entry, or even before for scheduling."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you protect my art collection after a fire?",
      answer: "Art protection is immediate priority. We coordinate with professional art handlers for safe relocation, establish climate control for pieces that can't be moved, and stabilize conditions to prevent ongoing damage. Documentation for insurance purposes begins immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "What about smoke damage to my wine cellar?",
      answer: "Even if flames never reached your cellar, smoke can penetrate the space and affect bottles. We assess conditions immediately—checking for soot deposits, odor penetration, and climate disruption. For affected collections, we coordinate with wine specialists for professional evaluation and cleaning."
    },
    {
      question: "My fire was small, but smoke went everywhere—what should I do?",
      answer: "Small fires often create disproportionate smoke damage. Soot is corrosive and damages surfaces permanently if not removed promptly. Call us immediately—even a contained fire can create smoke damage throughout a 20,000-square-foot estate that requires professional restoration."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle firefighting water damage?",
      answer: "Firefighting water often creates as much damage as the fire. We deploy industrial extraction and drying throughout all affected areas, including finished basements that received cascade water. Fire damage claims typically cover both fire and firefighting water damage."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with my insurance on fire damage claims?",
      answer: "Yes. Fire damage claims for Great Falls estates are often complex and high-value. We provide detailed documentation—room-by-room assessments, photographic evidence, material inventories—that supports complete coverage. Our experience with high-value claims helps ensure nothing is overlooked."
