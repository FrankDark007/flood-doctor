    paragraphs: [
      `Great Falls' mature tree canopy—the oaks and maples that define estate landscapes—becomes a liability during severe storms. When wind topples a 100-year-old oak onto your manor's roof, or lightning strikes a tree that falls through your pool house, damage can cascade through your property in seconds. Your 18,000-square-foot estate, exposed to the elements through a breached roof, faces water damage that multiplies with every passing hour.

Flood Doctor responds to Great Falls storm emergencies within 30 minutes. We've tarped storm-damaged roofs along Georgetown Pike, extracted water from manors hit by fallen trees, and restored equestrian facilities damaged by summer microbursts. When storm damage threatens your estate, we arrive with industrial equipment scaled for the largest properties—and crews experienced in protecting the irreplaceable assets Great Falls homes contain.`,

      `Great Falls storm damage challenges differ from suburban areas. Multi-acre properties mean more trees that can fall—and further distances for debris to travel. Multiple structures—main residence, guest house, pool house, equestrian facilities—multiply points of vulnerability. The same storms that topple trees can overwhelm drainage, flooding lower levels while roof damage lets water in from above.

Our IICRC-certified crews understand that storm restoration in Great Falls means protecting wine cellars from water intrusion while tarping breached roofs, securing art from wind exposure while extracting flood water, and coordinating emergency repairs for multiple structures simultaneously.`
    ],
    localContext: "Great Falls' estate properties with mature trees, multiple structures, and high-value assets require storm response that suburban companies can't provide. We arrive prepared for the scale and complexity these properties demand."

        title: "Mature Tree Hazards",
        description: "Great Falls' century-old oaks and maples provide estate character but create significant storm risk. When 80-foot trees fall, they can strike main residences, guest houses, pool houses, and equestrian facilities—sometimes multiple structures from a single tree.",
        solution: "We coordinate emergency tree removal while protecting underlying structures. Our crews work with tree services experienced in estate work—safe removal that considers all structures, driveways, and landscaping during the process."

        title: "Multi-Structure Vulnerability",
        description: "Great Falls estates often include multiple buildings across several acres. Storms can damage some or all structures, and limited visibility during weather events means some damage goes unnoticed until inspection.",

      question: "A tree fell on my roof—what should I do first?",
      answer: "If anyone is injured, call 911. If safe, move valuable items away from the damage area and call us at (703) 656-0112. Don't attempt to remove the tree yourself—improper removal can cause further structural damage. We'll coordinate safe tree removal while protecting your property."
    },
    {
      question: "My power is out after the storm—can you still work?",
      answer: "Yes. We bring generators for our equipment and can operate independently of your property's power. Many storm responses happen during outages—our equipment is designed for exactly these situations."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with my insurance on storm damage claims?",
      answer: "Yes. We handle direct billing with all carriers and provide the comprehensive documentation storm claims require. Our assessment reports, photographs, and moisture readings support complete claim coverage. For Great Falls high-value properties, thorough documentation often determines claim outcomes."

      question: "How do you protect my wine cellar during storm damage restoration?",
      answer: "Wine cellar protection starts immediately. If the cellar isn't directly affected, we establish barriers to prevent water migration during restoration. If storm damage threatens the cellar, we address climate control concerns throughout the process—using precision drying methods that protect your collection."
