    paragraphs: [
      `A burst pipe in a Great Falls estate can release thousands of gallons before anyone notices. Your 18,000-square-foot manor has plumbing that runs through multiple floors and wings—a supply line failure in a fourth-floor bathroom can cascade water down through finished ceilings, custom millwork, art-filled galleries, and into your wine cellar three floors below. By the time you discover the flooding, damage may span your entire property.

Flood Doctor responds to Great Falls burst pipe emergencies within 30 minutes. We've handled supply line failures in Forestville manors, frozen pipe bursts in Seneca Estates properties, and well system ruptures throughout the Georgetown Pike corridor. Our crews arrive with industrial extraction equipment scaled for estate-sized water events—because a burst pipe in a 15,000-square-foot home creates damage that subdivision-sized equipment can't address.`,

      `Great Falls plumbing emergencies present unique challenges. Most properties rely on private well systems with pressure tanks that can fail catastrophically. Large estates have extensive plumbing networks—hundreds of feet of supply lines running through unheated spaces, guest wings, pool houses, and outbuildings. Freeze damage during winter affects pipes in spaces that subdivision homes don't have.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers understand the complexity of Great Falls estate plumbing. We trace water migration through multiple floors, identify damage in areas far from the burst, and coordinate with plumbers who specialize in high-end residential systems. One call handles everything—from emergency extraction to complete restoration.`

    localContext: "Great Falls estates feature plumbing complexity that multiplies burst pipe damage—guest wings, pool houses, well systems, and multi-story water migration paths. We respond with equipment and expertise scaled for these properties."

      question: "How quickly can you respond to a burst pipe in Great Falls?",
      answer: "We guarantee 30-minute response to all Great Falls properties. When you call (703) 656-0112, we immediately guide you to shut off water if safe, then dispatch from our McLean staging area. We reach Forestville, Seneca Estates, Georgetown Pike, and all Great Falls locations within our guaranteed timeframe."
    },
    {
      question: "A pipe burst upstairs—how do I know if damage reached lower levels?",
      answer: "In Great Falls estates, you often can't know without professional assessment. Water travels through wall cavities, ceiling spaces, and structural paths that aren't visible. Our thermal imaging traces water migration through every level, identifying hidden damage before it causes mold problems. Don't assume damage is limited to the visible area."
    },
    {
      question: "My well system caused the burst—do you handle that?",
      answer: "Yes. Most Great Falls properties operate on private wells, so we frequently respond to well system failures. We coordinate with well specialists for repair while handling all water extraction and drying. Our documentation clearly identifies the mechanical failure for insurance purposes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you protect my art and wine cellar when a pipe bursts above them?",
      answer: "Asset protection is our first priority after safety. We establish barriers, coordinate relocation when necessary, and use climate-controlled drying that maintains appropriate conditions for wine cellars. For significant art collections, we work with professional art handlers for safe relocation."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you work with my plumber or recommend one?",
      answer: "Either. If you have an established relationship with a plumber, we coordinate with them. If you need a recommendation, we work with several plumbers who specialize in Great Falls estate plumbing—they understand private well systems and high-end residential work."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does burst pipe restoration take in a large estate?",
      answer: "Depending on the extent of damage, expect 5-10 days for complete drying across multiple floors and wings. Great Falls estates with significant damage may require longer. We provide daily moisture monitoring and won't declare the project complete until levels are safe throughout all affected areas."
