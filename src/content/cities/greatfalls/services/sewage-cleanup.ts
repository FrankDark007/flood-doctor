    paragraphs: [
      `Nearly every Great Falls estate operates on a private septic system—and when these systems fail, the consequences are immediate and serious. Sewage backing up into your finished lower level isn't just property damage; it's a biohazard emergency that threatens your family's health and requires specialized cleanup protocols most restoration companies aren't equipped to handle.

Flood Doctor has responded to septic emergencies throughout Great Falls for nearly two decades. We've cleaned up backups in Forestville estates, decontaminated finished basements in Seneca Estates properties, and restored lower levels throughout the Georgetown Pike corridor. When sewage threatens your home, we respond within 30 minutes with crews certified in Category 3 biohazard remediation—not general restoration workers learning on your property.`,

      `Great Falls septic systems face unique challenges. Multi-acre estates often have septic infrastructure that's decades old—clay pipes that mature trees have infiltrated, drain fields that have reached capacity, and tanks that haven't been maintained to match occupancy changes. These systems serve properties with 8+ bathrooms, guest houses, pool houses, and sometimes equestrian facilities—demanding loads that can overwhelm aging infrastructure.

Our IICRC Master Water Restorers and biohazard-certified crews understand that sewage cleanup in Great Falls means protecting irreplaceable assets while ensuring complete decontamination. Your wine cellar, your custom finishes, your family's health—all require the thoroughness and discretion we provide.`

    localContext: "Great Falls' private septic systems—often serving large estates with significant plumbing loads—require specialized backup cleanup. We respond with biohazard protocols, septic system expertise, and the discretion Great Falls homeowners expect."

    {
      question: "How quickly can you respond to a sewage backup in Great Falls?",
      answer: "We guarantee 30-minute response with biohazard-equipped crews. Sewage backup creates immediate health risks—every minute of delay exposes your family and spreads contamination. Call (703) 656-0112 immediately upon discovering a backup."
    },
    {
      question: "Is sewage backup dangerous?",
      answer: "Yes. Sewage contains bacteria, viruses, and parasites that pose serious health risks. Category 3 (black water) contamination requires professional biohazard cleanup—not DIY attempts. Keep family members and pets away from affected areas until our certified crews arrive."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with septic contractors to fix the underlying problem?",
      answer: "Yes. While we handle the biohazard cleanup, we coordinate with septic specialists who can camera lines, assess tank and drain field condition, and repair the failure that caused the backup. Addressing root causes prevents recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to the contaminated materials?",
      answer: "Porous materials that contacted sewage—carpet, pad, some fabrics, unsealed wood—must be removed for proper disposal. Hard surfaces and sealed materials can often be decontaminated. We document everything for insurance and follow all disposal regulations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you protect my wine cellar during sewage cleanup?",
      answer: "If your wine cellar wasn't directly affected, we establish barriers to prevent cross-contamination during cleanup. If sewage reached your cellar, we work to protect your collection while thoroughly decontaminating the space. Climate control concerns are addressed throughout."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer discrete service for sewage situations?",
      answer: "Absolutely—discretion is standard for all Great Falls work. We use unmarked vehicles, maintain strict confidentiality, and coordinate timing around your preferences. A sewage backup is stressful enough without neighborhood awareness."
