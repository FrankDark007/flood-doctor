**Groundwater intrusion:**
Great Falls' terrain and soil create groundwater challenges:
- High water table in some areas
- Seasonal water table rise
- Hydrostatic pressure against foundation
- Entry through floor-wall joints and cracks

**Surface water infiltration:**
Water from rain and runoff:

- Where grading directs water toward foundation
- During heavy storms

**Plumbing failures:**
Finished basements have plumbing:
- Bathroom supply lines and fixtures
- Bar sinks and ice makers
- Laundry connections
- Water heater (often located in basement)

**HVAC condensate:**
Air conditioning creates moisture:
- Clogged condensate lines
- Failed drain pans
- Improper drainage
- Often unnoticed until damage occurs

**Sump pump failure:**
The last line of defense fails:
- Power outage during storm
- Mechanical failure
- Overwhelmed capacity
- Stuck float switch`
