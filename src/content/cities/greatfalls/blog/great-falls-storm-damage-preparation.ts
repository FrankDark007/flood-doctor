    introduction: `Great Falls' wooded, semi-rural setting brings natural beauty—and storm vulnerability. Large trees, extensive properties, and complex systems all face risk during severe weather. Heavy rain can overwhelm drainage, wind can down trees onto structures, and power outages disable protective systems.

Proper preparation protects both your property and your ability to respond when storms arrive.`,

        heading: "Great Falls Storm Vulnerabilities",
        content: `Estate properties face specific risks:

**Tree exposure:**
Great Falls' signature mature trees are beautiful but dangerous:
- Large trees near structures can cause catastrophic damage
- Root systems affect drainage and foundations
- Falling limbs damage roofs and penetrate structures
- Debris clogs gutters and drains

**Extensive drainage needs:**
Large properties require comprehensive drainage:
- Long drives channel water
- Large roof areas concentrate runoff
- Grading over large areas must be maintained
- Culverts and drains can clog

**Power outage impact:**
Wooded areas lose power more frequently:
- Sump pumps fail without backup
- Security and monitoring systems down
- HVAC stops (including dehumidification)
- Well pumps fail (for properties on wells)

**Remote locations:**
Some Great Falls properties are secluded:
- Longer response times in emergencies
- Access can be blocked by fallen trees
- Communication may be compromised
- Self-reliance more important

**Complex systems:**
Estate homes have more to protect:
- Multiple HVAC zones
- Pool and spa equipment
- Irrigation systems
- Security systems
- Smart home components`

**Tree assessment:**
Evaluate trees for storm risk:
- Professional arborist inspection
- Dead or dying trees removed
- Weak limbs trimmed
- Trees near structures evaluated
- Consider preventive removal for high-risk trees

**Drainage system maintenance:**
Ensure water flows away:
- Clean gutters and downspouts
- Verify drainage system function
