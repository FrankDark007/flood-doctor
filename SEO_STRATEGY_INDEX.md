## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: How long until we see results?**
A: Initial rankings (top 20) appear 60-90 days from consistent implementation. Top 10 rankings typically appear 4-6 months. Full strategy impact at 6-12 months.

**Q: What if we can't publish 2 articles/week?**
A: Start with 1 article/week. Still effective, just slower timeline. Quality matters more than quantity.

**Q: Should we do paid ads while building organic?**
A: For emergency services, yes—use Google Local Service Ads immediately. Phase out as organic grows.

**Q: How do we measure ROI?**
A: Track leads from organic search in Google Analytics. Compare cost per acquisition (organic) vs. paid ads over time.

**Q: What if we have an existing blog?**
A: Audit existing content for keyword overlap. Update and relink old content. Focus new articles on keyword gaps.
