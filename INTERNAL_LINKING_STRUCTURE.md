## Linking Patterns by Type

### 1. Blog Article Linking

**Basement Flooding Guide** (Exemplary - follow this pattern)

Current links (good):
```
Internal links: 5
- /resources/insurance-claims-guide/
- /blog/sump-pump-failure-basement-flooding-nova/
- /resources/water-damage-cost-guide/
- /resources/mold-prevention-guide/
- /blog/water-damage-northern-virginia-guide/
```

**Target enhancement** (8-10 links):
```
In main content:
1. Foundation Cracks link to: "Learn about structural drying" → /blog/professional-drying-dehumidification/
2. Sump Pump Failures link to: "Prevent sump pump failure" → /blog/sump-pump-failure-basement-flooding-nova/
3. Restoration Cost section link to: "See detailed cost breakdown" → /resources/water-damage-cost-guide/
4. Insurance Coverage link to: "Review your policy" → /resources/insurance-documentation-guide/
5. Waterproofing Solutions link to: "Compare solutions" → /blog/home-waterproofing-guide/

In sidebar:
6. Related article: Hidden Water Damage Signs
7. Related article: Mold Prevention After Flooding
8. Related resource: Restoration Timeline
9. Related location: Service Areas page
10. Related service: Emergency Response page
```

### 2. Location Page Linking

**Currently weak - All location pages should follow this pattern:**

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Breadcrumb (Hero section)
2. Main content (500+ words)
   - Service overview
   - Location-specific challenges
   - Local expertise
   - Links: 3-5 relevant blog articles
3. Service cards section
   - Links to all applicable services for that location
4. Related blog articles section
   - 3-5 most relevant blog posts
5. Testimonials (if available)
6. FAQ section (location-specific)
7. Call-to-action footer

LINKING PATTERN for Alexandria example:
- Main body: Link "basin flooding in Alexandria" to /blog/basement-flooding-loudoun-county/ (or Alexandria-specific variant if exists)
- Main body: Link "water damage prevention" to /blog/water-damage-northern-virginia-guide/
- Main body: Link "insurance documentation" to /resources/insurance-documentation-guide/
- Service cards: Links to /services/residential/water-damage/, /services/residential/mold-remediation/
- Related articles section:
  * Water Damage in Northern Virginia: Complete Guide
  * Hidden Water Damage Signs in Arlington
  * Sump Pump Failure Prevention
  * Mold Prevention After Flooding
  * Insurance Claims Guide
```

### 3. Service Page Linking

**Pattern for all service/landing pages:**

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Hero with breadcrumb
2. Service overview (200-300 words)
   - Links: Related blog articles (2-3)
3. How it works section
   - Links: Process/timeline article
4. Benefits section
5. Why choose us section
6. Service areas section
   - Links: Location pages for each service area
7. Related services section
   - Links: Complementary services
8. FAQ section
   - Links: Detailed FAQ page
9. Testimonials
10. CTA footer
```

## Anchor Text Best Practices

### Good Anchor Text (Descriptive)
```html
<!-- ✅ Good: Specific and keyword-relevant -->
<a href="/blog/basement-flooding-guide/">basement flooding prevention guide</a>
<a href="/resources/insurance-claims/">step-by-step insurance claims documentation</a>
<a href="/blog/mold-growth-timeline/">learn when mold begins growing after water damage</a>
```

### Bad Anchor Text (Generic)
```html
<!-- ❌ Bad: Vague, no context -->
<a href="/blog/basement-flooding-guide/">click here</a>
<a href="/resources/insurance-claims/">learn more</a>
<a href="/blog/mold-growth-timeline/">read this article</a>
```

### Mixed Approach (Recommended for Natural Feel)
```html
<!-- ✅ Good: Balanced approach for readability -->
<p>
  Every hour of delay increases mold risk. See our
  <a href="/blog/mold-growth-timeline/">detailed timeline on mold growth</a>
  to understand the risks of delayed restoration.
</p>

<p>
  Most homeowners insurance covers sudden water damage. Check our
  <a href="/resources/insurance-claims-guide/">comprehensive insurance claims guide</a>
  for coverage details specific to water damage in Virginia.
</p>
