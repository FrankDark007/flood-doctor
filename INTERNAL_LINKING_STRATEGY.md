## PART 1: CORE LINKING PRINCIPLES

### The Pillar + Cluster Model

**Pillar Pages** (Hub):
- Comprehensive guide covering entire topic (2,500-3,500 words)
- High-level overview with multiple subtopic sections
- Links to all supporting cluster topics
- Ranks for primary keyword and variations
- Example: "Water Damage Restoration: Complete Guide"

**Cluster Pages** (Supporting Content):
- Deep dive into specific subtopic (1,500-2,500 words)
- Highly targeted to specific keyword or search intent
- Links back to pillar page
- Links to other related cluster pages
- Example: "Water Damage Restoration Timeline"

### Strategic Linking Rules

1. **Relevance First**: Only link when contextually relevant
2. **Anchor Text Matters**: Use keyword-rich anchors for SEO signals
3. **Link Depth**: Surface important pages (max 3 clicks from home)
4. **Consistency**: Always link the same topic using consistent anchor text
5. **Balance**: Mix keyword anchors with brand and natural anchors
6. **Authority Flow**: Link from high-authority pages to priority content

## CONCLUSION

This internal linking strategy creates a semantic framework that:

1. **Establishes topical authority** through cluster-based linking
2. **Distributes page authority** to priority ranking pages
3. **Improves crawlability** with logical site structure
4. **Enhances user experience** with contextual navigation
5. **Maximizes SEO value** through strategic anchor text

Implementation should follow the phased roadmap starting with pillar page creation, then building cluster topics, and finally optimizing navigation and cross-linking across all content.

Regular monitoring of internal link performance ensures the strategy remains effective as new content is added.
