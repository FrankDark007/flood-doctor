When water threatens these properties, you need restoration experts who understand the stakes and can navigate the discrete service requirements these homes demand.

Flood Doctor has protected properties within The Reserve for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from wine cellars designed by nationally recognized architects, dried home theaters with custom acoustic treatments, and restored finished basements that rival luxury hotels. Our crews understand The Reserve's gate protocols, work with property managers when owners travel, and maintain the discretion these homeowners expect.

The homes here—7,000 to 15,000+ square feet of custom construction on 1-3 acre lots—present restoration challenges that typical companies can't handle. Custom HVAC systems distribute water damage throughout massive floor plates. Wine cellars require temperature-controlled drying. Art collections and antiques demand individual protection. We scale our response to match the property.`,housingTypes:["Custom estates (7,000-15,000+ sq ft)","Architect-designed luxury homes","Multi-level properties with extensive basements","Pool houses and guest cottages"],commonIssues:["Wine cellar humidity and flooding damage","Home theater water intrusion","Pool house and cabana pipe failures","Complex HVAC system water distribution","Foundation seepage in luxury finishes"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["The Reserve main gate (Old Dominion Drive)","Georgetown Pike boundary","Scott's Run Nature Preserve (adjacent)","Great Falls Park (nearby)"],developmentInfo:{developer:"Miller & Smith",yearsDeveloped:"1990-early 2000s",totalHomes:"166 estates",acreage:"255 acres",lotSizes:"1-3+ acres"},amenities:["24/7 gated security","Private roads","Community open space","Nature preserve access"],localFacts:["ZIP code: 22102","Home values: $3M-$15M+","Lot sizes: 1-3+ acres","HOA managed community"]},serviceList:[{name:"Estate Emergency Response",description:"Coordinated response for The Reserve's unique requirements: gate access, property manager notification, homeowner travel coordination.
