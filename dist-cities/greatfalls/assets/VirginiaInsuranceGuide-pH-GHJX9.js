However, if your home is in a FEMA-designated high-risk flood zone (A or V zones) and you have a federally backed mortgage, your lender will require National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) coverage. Even outside high-risk zones, flooding is the #1 natural disaster nationwide, and flood insurance is highly recommended."},{question:"What is the difference between flood insurance and homeowners insurance?",answer:"Homeowners insurance covers sudden, accidental water damage from internal sources (burst pipes, appliance failures, storm roof leaks). Flood insurance covers rising water from external sources like rivers, heavy rain, storm surge, and snowmelt. Standard homeowners policies specifically exclude flood damage, requiring separate NFIP or private flood coverage."},{question:"How long does it take to file a disaster insurance claim in Virginia?",answer:"You should report damage to your insurance company within 24-48 hours. The adjuster typically inspects within 3-7 days. Initial claim settlements average 30-60 days, though complex claims can take 90+ days. FEMA Individual Assistance (if declared) can take several weeks to months for approval and payment."},{question:"What disasters are covered by Virginia homeowners insurance?",answer:"Most Virginia homeowners policies cover windstorm damage, hail, lightning, fire, theft, and sudden water damage from internal sources. Typically excluded: flood, earthquake (requires endorsement), sewer backup (requires endorsement), gradual damage, and maintenance-related issues. Review your declarations page for specifics."},{question:"Does Virginia law protect homeowners during insurance claims?",answer:"Yes. Virginia Code § 38.2-510 prohibits unfair claim settlement practices. The State Corporation Commission's Bureau of Insurance handles complaints. Virginia follows the 'valued policy law' for total losses and requires insurers to act in good faith. You have the right to hire a public adjuster or attorney if your claim is denied or undervalued."},{question:"Can my insurance company cancel my policy after a claim in Virginia?",answer:"In Virginia, insurers cannot cancel your policy mid-term except for non-payment, fraud, or material misrepresentation. However, they can choose not to renew your policy at the end of the term. Filing one claim rarely triggers non-renewal, but multiple claims within 3-5 years may increase premiums or lead to non-renewal."},{question:"What is the Virginia Property Insurance Association (VPIA)?",answer:"The VPIA is Virginia's insurer of last resort for coastal properties that cannot obtain coverage in the private market. It provides wind and hail coverage for properties in designated coastal areas. VPIA is more expensive than standard insurance and has higher deductibles, but ensures availability for high-risk coastal properties."},{question:"How do I qualify for FEMA Individual Assistance in Virginia?",answer:"FEMA Individual Assistance is only available after a Presidential Disaster Declaration. To qualify, you must: 1) Live in a declared disaster county, 2) Have uninsured or underinsured losses, 3) Register with FEMA within 60 days of declaration, and 4) Pass income/asset verification. FEMA assistance is a grant (not repaid) for essential needs, but does not cover all losses."}],h={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:o.map(s=>({"@type":"Question",name:s.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:s.answer}}))},p=[{icon:j,name:"Hurricanes & Tropical Storms",description:"Coastal Virginia faces hurricane risk June-November.
