This includes past flooding, basement seepage, roof leaks, plumbing failures, foundation issues, mold remediation, and any current or past water-related structural damage. Even if the damage was repaired, disclosure is required if it was material (significant enough to affect the buyer's decision)."},{question:"Do I have to disclose old water damage that was professionally repaired?",answer:"Yes. Virginia law requires disclosure of all known material defects regardless of repair status. You must disclose the original problem, when it occurred, what repairs were completed, and who performed the work. Proper documentation of professional restoration protects both seller and buyer and typically doesn't reduce property value if repairs meet industry standards."},{question:"What happens if I don't disclose water damage when selling my Virginia home?",answer:"Failure to disclose known water damage exposes sellers to serious legal consequences including contract rescission (buyer cancels the sale and gets their deposit back), post-closing lawsuits for repair costs and damages, punitive damages for intentional concealment, and potential fraud charges. Virginia courts consistently rule in favor of buyers when sellers fail to disclose material defects."},{question:"Can I be held liable for water damage I didn't know about?",answer:"Generally no, but only if you truly had no knowledge of the problem. Virginia law requires disclosure of known defects. However, sellers are expected to conduct reasonable inspections. If a problem was obvious or should have been discovered during basic home maintenance, courts may find constructive knowledge. Pre-listing inspections protect sellers by documenting what was and wasn't known."},{question:"How does water damage disclosure affect my home's value in Northern Virginia?",answer:"Impact depends entirely on documentation quality. Properly disclosed and professionally repaired water damage with complete documentation (certified restoration, mold clearance, structural repairs) typically has minimal impact—often 0-3% value reduction. Undisclosed damage discovered during buyer inspections creates negotiation leverage for 10-20% reductions or deal cancellations. Professional certification is key."},{question:"What documentation should I provide when disclosing water damage?",answer:"Provide complete restoration documentation including the original damage assessment, moisture readings and thermal imaging, scope of work performed, all invoices and receipts, mold clearance testing results (if applicable), structural repair certifications, before and after photos, and contractor licenses and insurance certificates. IICRC-certified restoration documentation is gold standard and reassures buyers."}],y={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:x.map(s=>({"@type":"Question",name:s.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:s.answer}}))},w={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Article",headline:"Water Damage Disclosure: What Virginia Home Sellers Must Know",description:"Complete guide to water damage disclosure requirements for Virginia home sellers.
