Capture close-ups of damaged materials (wet drywall, carpet, flooring) and any damaged belongings. Take wide shots showing the entire affected area and detail shots showing moisture intrusion. Use your phone's timestamp feature and take 50-100+ photos minimum."},{question:"Do I need to save receipts for emergency mitigation services?",answer:"Yes. Your insurance policy requires you to mitigate further damage, and emergency mitigation costs (water extraction, tarping, board-up) are typically reimbursable. Save receipts for all emergency services, temporary repairs, equipment rentals, and related expenses. These expenses are separate from your deductible and are covered under your policy's emergency mitigation clause."},{question:"How long should I keep my insurance claim documentation?",answer:"Keep all claim-related documentation for at least 5-7 years. This includes photos, estimates, receipts, correspondence, the final settlement, and proof of repairs. If disputes arise or if you sell your property, having complete documentation is essential. Store digital copies in cloud storage and physical copies in a waterproof, fireproof safe."},{question:"Should I create a video walkthrough of the damage?",answer:"Yes. Video walkthroughs provide context that photos alone can't capture. Record a slow, steady walkthrough of all affected areas while narrating what you're showing. Point out the water source, trace the path of water intrusion, and show the full extent of damage. Videos should be 5-15 minutes and supplement—not replace—detailed photos."},{question:"What if I didn't take photos before cleanup started?",answer:"While before-cleanup photos are critical, document what you can immediately. Photograph materials as they're removed (wet insulation, carpet padding), moisture meter readings, and any remaining damage. Take photos of extracted water in buckets, wet materials piled outside, and equipment in use. Explain to your adjuster that emergency mitigation was necessary to prevent mold. Your restoration contractor's documentation can also support your claim."},{question:"Do I need to document every damaged item individually?",answer:"For high-value items (electronics, furniture, appliances), photograph each item individually showing brand, model, and damage. For general contents (clothing, books, kitchenware), you can photograph groups by category. Create a detailed written inventory with descriptions, approximate purchase dates, and estimated replacement costs for all damaged items. The more detail you provide, the stronger your contents claim."},{question:"Should I keep a log of all communication with my insurance company?",answer:"Absolutely. Maintain a detailed communication log including date, time, person's name/title, method of contact (phone/email), and a summary of what was discussed. Note any promises made, deadlines given, or information requested. This log becomes critical if disputes arise or if you need to escalate your claim. Follow up verbal conversations with email summaries to create a paper trail."},{question:"Can my restoration company help with documentation?",answer:"Yes. Professional restoration companies like Flood Doctor provide comprehensive documentation including thermal imaging, moisture mapping, photographic evidence, and detailed scope-of-work estimates. We use Xactimate (the same software insurance companies use) to create line-item estimates, coordinate with adjusters, and maintain daily logs. Professional documentation significantly strengthens your claim and reduces disputes."}],x={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:u.map(t=>({"@type":"Question",name:t.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:t.answer}}))},g=[{priority:"Critical",time:"0-2 Hours",icon:m,title:"Photograph Water Source & Standing Water",description:"Before any cleanup, photograph the source of water (pipe, roof leak, appliance), standing water depth, and water spread throughout affected areas.",items:["Source of leak/flooding (close-up and wide shot)","Standing water levels with ruler/measurement","Water spread across floors, rooms, levels","Ceiling stains or bulging if water is from above"]},{priority:"Critical",time:"0-2 Hours",icon:z,title:"Record Video Walkthrough",description:"Take a slow video walkthrough of all affected areas while narrating what you're showing.
