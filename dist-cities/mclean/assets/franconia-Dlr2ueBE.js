When water threatens these homes, you need restoration experts who understand the diverse housing stock and the busy professionals who live here.

Flood Doctor has served Franconia families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from colonials near Beulah Road, dried the townhomes in newer developments, and protected the properties of military families heading to Fort Belvoir. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Franconia, not in a distant warehouse—when you call about a water emergency, we're already nearby.

The housing here ranges from established single-family homes to newer townhome communities. Each type presents different challenges: older homes may have aging infrastructure while townhomes require HOA coordination. We handle both with the expertise Franconia homeowners expect.`,housingTypes:["Single-family colonials and split-levels","Newer townhome communities","Properties near Franconia-Springfield Metro","Homes ranging from 1,200-2,500 sq ft"],commonIssues:["Basement and lower-level flooding during storms","Pipe failures in aging single-family homes","Townhome water damage affecting shared walls","Appliance and HVAC leaks","Storm drainage issues in lower-lying areas"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["Franconia-Springfield Metro Station","Springfield Town Center","Beulah Road corridor","Van Dorn Street","Fairfax County Parkway access"],schools:["Edison High School","Twain Middle School","Franconia Elementary","Bush Hill Elementary"],subdivisions:["Franconia Park","Bush Hill","Springfield Forest","Monticello Forest","Franconia Station"],localFacts:["ZIP code: 22310","Metro accessible neighborhood","Mix of established and newer housing","School district: FCPS (Fairfax County)"]},serviceList:[{name:"Emergency Water Extraction",description:"Rapid response for Franconia flooding, burst pipes, and appliance failures.
