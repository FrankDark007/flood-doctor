But proximity to Four Mile Run also brings flood vulnerability that other Arlington neighborhoods don't face. When water threatens these properties—whether from storms, plumbing, or the creek itself—you need restoration experts who understand both Shirlington's building stock and its flood patterns.

Flood Doctor has served Shirlington for nearly two decades. We've extracted storm water from basement apartments after Four Mile Run rose, dried townhomes after supply line failures, and restored commercial spaces in Shirlington Village after unexpected water events. Our crews are positioned minutes from Shirlington—ready for any water emergency.

The neighborhood's mix—townhomes, garden apartments, and the Village's mixed-use buildings—requires versatility. Each building type presents different water damage patterns and restoration requirements. We've learned Shirlington through thousands of projects across every property type.`,housingTypes:["Townhome communities","Garden-style apartment complexes","Mixed-use buildings in Shirlington Village","Mid-rise apartment buildings","Single-family homes (adjacent areas)"],commonIssues:["Four Mile Run flooding during major storms","Basement apartment flooding from storm water","Townhome supply line failures","Storm drain backup into lower levels","Commercial kitchen water damage in restaurants"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["Shirlington Village","Signature Theatre","Four Mile Run Trail","Shirlington Library","Barcroft Park (adjacent)"],schools:["Barcroft Elementary School","Gunston Middle School","Wakefield High School"],subdivisions:["Shirlington Village","Shirlington East","Fairlington (adjacent)","Barcroft (adjacent)"],localFacts:["ZIP code: 22206","Flood zone: Four Mile Run watershed","Village character: Arts and dining district","Housing mix: Townhomes and apartments"]},serviceList:[{name:"Four Mile Run Flood Response",description:"Shirlington sits in the Four Mile Run watershed.
