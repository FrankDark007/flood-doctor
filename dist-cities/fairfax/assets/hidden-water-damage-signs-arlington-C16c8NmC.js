Arlington's older housing stock often hides water damage behind finished walls, under carpeting, and in crawlspaces."},{question:"How can I detect water damage I can't see?",answer:"Professional moisture meters and thermal imaging cameras detect hidden moisture behind walls, under floors, and in ceilings. You can also watch for secondary indicators: warping baseboards, stuck doors or windows, mold growth in unusual places, or water stains appearing after heavy rain. If you suspect hidden damage, hire a certified inspector with professional detection equipment."},{question:"Can hidden water damage cause health problems?",answer:"Yes. Hidden water damage often leads to mold growth in wall cavities, insulation, and HVAC systems. Mold exposure causes respiratory issues, allergic reactions, asthma exacerbation, headaches, and fatigue. Older Arlington homes with poor ventilation and high humidity are especially prone to mold-related health issues."},{question:"How long does it take for hidden water damage to cause mold?",answer:"Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of water exposure in dark, enclosed spaces like wall cavities and crawlspaces. Arlington's humid summers accelerate this timeline. Once mold starts growing behind walls, it spreads rapidly and becomes expensive to remediate—typically $3,000-$10,000 or more."},{question:"What should I do if I suspect hidden water damage in my Arlington home?",answer:"Contact a professional water damage restoration company immediately for a moisture inspection. Flood Doctor uses thermal imaging and moisture meters to detect hidden damage without invasive demolition. We provide free assessments and can coordinate with your insurance if restoration is needed. Don't wait—hidden damage worsens daily."},{question:"Does homeowners insurance cover hidden water damage in Arlington?",answer:"It depends on the cause. Insurance typically covers sudden, accidental water damage (burst pipes, appliance failures) even if the damage is hidden. However, gradual damage from slow leaks, deferred maintenance, or long-term moisture problems is usually excluded. Early detection and documentation are critical for insurance claims."}],w={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:h.map(s=>({"@type":"Question",name:s.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:s.answer}}))},b={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Article",headline:"Signs of Hidden Water Damage in Your Arlington Home",description:"Expert guide to detecting hidden water damage in Arlington VA homes.
