Cupping often reverses with proper drying but may require sanding and refinishing."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"How long does it take to dry hardwood floors after water damage?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Initial drying takes 7-14 days with professional equipment, followed by 2-4 weeks of acclimation as the wood returns to equilibrium moisture content.

Minor cupping often reverses completely with no visible evidence remaining. Moderate damage may leave slight irregularities detectable by touch but not appearance. Severe damage or improper drying can result in permanent unevenness. The key is allowing complete stabilization before refinishing and working with experienced restoration and flooring professionals who understand wood behavior."})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"border-b border-gray-200 pb-6",children:[e.jsx("h3",{className:"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3",children:"Should I remove baseboards during hardwood floor drying?"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-gray-700",children:"Yes, in most cases. Removing baseboards serves multiple purposes: allows inspection of floor edges and wall base for hidden moisture, creates airflow pathways for drying floor perimeter, prevents trapped moisture between baseboard and wall, and allows proper installation of drying equipment. Baseboards are typically removed during water damage restoration and reinstalled after drying completes. This prevents mold growth in concealed spaces and ensures thorough drying."})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"pb-6",children:[e.jsx("h3",{className:"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3",children:"Can I install new hardwood over water-damaged subfloor?"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-gray-700",children:"No, never install new hardwood over damaged subfloor without proper remediation. Compromised subfloor leads to squeaking, movement, premature finish failure, fastener pull-through, and ongoing moisture/mold issues. Subfloor must be dried to proper moisture content (typically below 12%), inspected for structural integrity, delaminated sections replaced, and antimicrobial treatment applied if contamination occurred. Proper subfloor preparation is essential for hardwood longevity regardless of whether floors are restored or replaced."})]})]})]}),e.jsx("section",{className:"bg-gradient-to-br from-[#1a73e8] to-[#1557b0] text-white p-8 rounded-2xl mb-12",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center",children:[e.jsx("h2",{className:"text-3xl font-bold mb-4",children:"Save Your Hardwood Floors—Act Now"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-lg mb-6 text-blue-50",children:"Every hour of delay reduces salvage probability.
