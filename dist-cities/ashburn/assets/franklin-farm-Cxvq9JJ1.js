When water threatens properties in this active neighborhood, you need restoration experts who understand both the homes and the families who live in them.

Flood Doctor has served Franklin Farm families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from single-family basements after storms, dried townhome lower levels after plumbing failures, and protected the recreation rooms and home offices that Franklin Farm families depend on. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Franklin Farm, not in a distant warehouse—when you call at 3 AM about a burst pipe, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here—ranging from spacious single-family colonials to attached townhomes—requires versatile restoration expertise. Finished basements serve as play areas, guest quarters, and home offices. Townhome water events can affect neighbors. We treat each Franklin Farm property with the thoroughness these family homes deserve.`,housingTypes:["Single-family colonials (2,500-4,000+ sq ft)","Traditional two-story homes","Attached townhomes","Cluster homes"],commonIssues:["Finished basement flooding from sump pump failure","Supply line failures affecting multiple levels","Foundation seepage from clay soil","Townhome water migration between units","HVAC condensate and appliance leaks"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["Franklin Farm Park","Franklin Farm community pool","Community center","W&OD Trail access"],sections:["Franklin Farm Village","Franklin Farm single-family sections","Townhome communities","Newer development areas"],schools:["Floris Elementary School","Franklin Middle School","South Lakes High School"],localFacts:["ZIP code: 20171","Established 1980s-2000s","Active HOA community","School district: FCPS (Fairfax County)"]},serviceList:[{name:"Emergency Water Extraction",description:"Rapid response for Franklin Farm flooding, burst pipes, and appliance failures.
