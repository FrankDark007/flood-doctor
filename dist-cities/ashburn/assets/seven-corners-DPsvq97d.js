The neighborhoods surrounding the Route 7/Route 50 intersection include 1950s-1960s colonials and split-levels on tree-lined streets, townhome communities, and the culturally vibrant Eden Center nearby. When water damage strikes in Seven Corners, you need restoration experts who understand the area's varied housing stock and respond fast.

Flood Doctor has served Seven Corners families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from basements in the established neighborhoods, dried finished lower levels in split-level homes, and protected the hardwood floors in mid-century colonials throughout the area. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Seven Corners—when you call about a burst pipe or basement flooding, we're already on the way.

Seven Corners housing spans multiple decades and styles. The 1950s-1960s colonials and split-levels that define many neighborhoods require different approaches than newer townhomes. Older homes have original plumbing, aging sump pumps, and foundations that have settled over decades. We bring the right expertise for whatever Seven Corners home we're serving.`,housingTypes:["1950s-1960s colonial homes","Mid-century split-level homes","1970s-1980s townhomes","Newer infill construction","Multi-family buildings"],commonIssues:["Basement flooding from sump pump failure","Burst pipe damage from aging plumbing","Storm drainage backup flooding","HVAC condensate leaks in older systems","Foundation seepage from settling"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["Eden Center","Seven Corners Shopping Center","Route 7/Route 50 intersection","Willston Centre","Bailey's Crossroads area"],schools:["Falls Church High School","Stuart High School","Glasgow Middle School","Willston Multicultural Center","Sleepy Hollow Elementary"],subdivisions:["Seven Corners proper","Sleepy Hollow Woods","Glen Forest","Willston","Bailey's area"],localFacts:["ZIP codes: 22044, 22041","Median home value: $500K-700K","Average lot size: 0.1-0.25 acres","School district: Fairfax County Public Schools"]},serviceList:[{name:"Emergency Water Extraction",description:"Rapid response for Seven Corners basement flooding, burst pipes, and appliance failures.
