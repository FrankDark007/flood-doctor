It establishes protocols for assessment, containment, removal, cleaning, and verification. The standard defines three remediation levels based on contamination area, requires specific PPE and containment procedures, and mandates post-remediation verification."},{question:"What is the difference between mold remediation and mold removal?",answer:"Mold removal refers to physically removing mold from surfaces. Mold remediation is a comprehensive process that includes identifying the moisture source, fixing it, containing the area, removing contaminated materials, cleaning salvageable surfaces, treating with antimicrobials, and verifying success. Complete remediation addresses the cause, not just the symptom."},{question:"Does Virginia require mold remediation licenses?",answer:"Yes. Virginia requires mold remediation contractors to be licensed through the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR). Companies must have licensed supervisors and workers, carry insurance, and follow established standards. Unlicensed mold work is illegal and may void insurance claims."},{question:"How much does professional mold remediation cost?",answer:"Costs vary by contamination area and class. Small areas (<10 sq ft): $500-$1,500. Medium areas (10-100 sq ft): $1,500-$5,000. Large areas (>100 sq ft): $5,000-$30,000+. Black mold (Stachybotrys) and Category 3 water damage increase costs due to safety requirements. Most homeowners insurance covers mold resulting from covered water damage."},{question:"What health risks does mold pose?",answer:"Mold exposure can cause respiratory issues, allergic reactions, asthma attacks, eye irritation, skin rashes, and chronic sinus infections. Immunocompromised individuals, children, elderly, and those with respiratory conditions face higher risks. Some molds produce mycotoxins that can cause severe health effects. Professional remediation eliminates exposure."},{question:"Can I remediate mold myself?",answer:"EPA guidelines allow DIY remediation for small areas (<10 sq ft) from clean water sources if you have no health conditions. However, areas >10 sq ft, black mold, Category 2-3 water damage, HVAC contamination, or hidden mold require professional remediation. Improper DIY work can spread spores and worsen contamination."},{question:"How do you verify mold remediation is complete?",answer:"Post-remediation verification includes visual inspection (no visible mold), moisture meter readings (materials dry to standard), and optional air quality testing or clearance testing by independent third-party hygienists. IICRC S520 requires documentation of all steps and conditions returning to Condition 1 (normal fungal ecology)."},{question:"Does homeowners insurance cover mold remediation?",answer:"Coverage depends on the mold's cause. If mold results from a covered peril (sudden pipe burst, storm damage), remediation is typically covered. Mold from maintenance neglect, gradual leaks, or flooding (requires flood insurance) is usually excluded. Many policies cap mold coverage at $5,000-$10,000.
