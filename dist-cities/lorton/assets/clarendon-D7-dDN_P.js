Century-old brick rowhouses feature aging plumbing hidden behind original plaster walls, limited equipment access through narrow front entries, and shared walls requiring neighbor coordination. Modern mixed-use buildings combine ground-floor restaurants with residential units above, where equipment failures create cross-occupancy damage patterns.

We navigate tight rowhouse configurations with compact restoration equipment, coordinate shared wall water damage with multiple property owners, and execute preservation-focused techniques protecting historic materials. For mixed-use properties, we manage the complexity of coordinating commercial and residential restoration simultaneously while minimizing disruption to thriving businesses below.

From Metro-adjacent high-density blocks to quieter residential streets near Courthouse, we've restored water damage throughout Clarendon's diverse building stock. Our team understands historic preservation requirements, mixed-use coordination challenges, and the access constraints that define urban restoration in Arlington's most dynamic neighborhood.`},servicesSection:{header:"Comprehensive Restoration Services for Clarendon Properties",services:[{title:"Historic Rowhouse Water Damage",description:"Preservation-focused restoration for Clarendon's brick rowhouses with expertise in shared walls, original plaster and woodwork, and period-appropriate repairs matching historic character."},{title:"Mixed-Use Building Coordination",description:"Specialized management when water damage affects both commercial and residential spaces, coordinating restaurant operations, retail businesses, and residential units in single restoration projects."},{title:"Combined Sewer Backup Cleanup",description:"Emergency response for sewage backups common in Clarendon's older sewer infrastructure during heavy rain, with hazmat protocols and backwater valve installation coordination."},{title:"Compact Space Restoration Solutions",description:"Urban-specific equipment and techniques for narrow rowhouses with front-entry-only access, tight stairs, and limited staging areas requiring specialized restoration approaches."},{title:"Multi-Property Coordination",description:"Expert management when shared plumbing or wall issues create water damage across multiple connected rowhouses requiring neighbor communication and synchronized restoration."},{title:"Restaurant Equipment Flood Cleanup",description:"Commercial kitchen water damage restoration for ground-floor restaurants with health code compliance, equipment assessment, and rapid reopening to minimize revenue loss."}]},emergencySection:{header:"24/7 Emergency Response Throughout Clarendon",availabilityContent:"Our Clarendon team responds within 60 minutes to any location from Wilson Boulevard to Washington Boulevard, navigating urban traffic and parking constraints to deliver immediate emergency service day or night.",ctaText:"Call (703) 656-0102 for immediate emergency water damage response in Clarendon."},buildingTypesSection:{header:"Clarendon Building Types We Serve",buildingTypes:[{name:"Historic Brick Rowhouses",description:"Clarendon's signature Victorian and Edwardian rowhouses built 1900-1940 with original plaster, wood floors, and shared-wall construction requiring specialized restoration techniques.",commonIssues:["Aging galvanized plumbing hidden behind historic plaster walls","Shared wall water damage requiring multi-property coordination","Limited equipment access through narrow front entries","Original wood floor water damage requiring gentle drying","Stone foundation seepage during heavy rain events"]},{name:"Mixed-Use Developments",description:"Modern buildings combining ground-floor retail or restaurants with residential condos above, creating unique restoration coordination challenges across different occupancy types.",commonIssues:["Restaurant equipment failures flooding residential units above","Grease trap and commercial plumbing backups affecting drainage","Separate building systems requiring different restoration protocols","Business continuity coordination minimizing commercial revenue loss","Complex insurance with commercial and residential policies overlapping"]},{name:"Mid-Rise Condo Buildings",description:"Contemporary 4-8 story residential buildings along major corridors with HOA management, shared amenities, and modern building systems requiring multi-unit coordination.",commonIssues:["Multi-unit water damage from single source failures","Shared HVAC and plumbing systems spreading contamination","HOA architectural review requirements for restoration work","Parking garage flooding in below-grade spaces","Balcony drainage failures causing interior water intrusion"]}]},processSection:{header:"Our Clarendon Restoration Process",steps:[{title:"Rapid Urban Response & Assessment",description:"Within 60 minutes, our team navigates to your Clarendon location with compact equipment suited for urban access.

Our team uses compact extraction units, portable dehumidifiers, and modular equipment sized specifically for narrow front entries, tight stairs, and limited staging areas. We've successfully restored hundreds of Clarendon rowhouses where standard truck-mounted equipment couldn't reach. When alley access exists, we utilize it for efficient equipment staging."},{question:"How do you handle water damage affecting my neighbor's rowhouse too?",answer:"Shared wall water damage is common in rowhouse construction. We coordinate communication with all affected property owners, assess damage across all properties simultaneously, provide individual estimates while offering economies of scale when multiple owners want coordinated restoration, and manage the project ensuring fair, efficient service for everyone involved. One restoration company handling connected properties is far more efficient than separate contractors."},{question:"Will restoration damage my historic rowhouse's original features?",answer:"We specialize in preservation-focused restoration protecting original materials. When historic plaster or woodwork is salvageable, we use gentle techniques rather than demolition. Moisture meters allow precise drying without unnecessary removal. Some water-damaged materials require replacement for safety, but we match period materials and finishes precisely. For designated historic properties, we coordinate with preservation authorities ensuring compliant work."},{question:"What if the restaurant below my condo has a flood that damages my unit?",answer:"Mixed-use water damage is our specialty in Clarendon. We coordinate with both the commercial tenant and residential owners, work with separate insurance policies covering each space, schedule work minimizing restaurant closure when possible, and manage the project holistically rather than treating commercial and residential restoration as separate projects. You get single-point-of-contact coordination across the entire building."},{question:"How quickly can you respond to emergencies in Clarendon's busy streets?",answer:"We respond within 60 minutes to any Clarendon location, 24/7. Our team knows the neighborhood intimately, navigating traffic patterns and parking constraints efficiently. We coordinate with property managers or building staff during dispatch, arrange parking or loading zone access when needed, and arrive equipped for immediate emergency response regardless of urban access challenges."},{question:"Do you understand Clarendon's combined sewer backup issues?",answer:"Absolutely. Combined sewers backing up during heavy rain are common in older Clarendon neighborhoods. We respond with hazmat protocols for sewage contamination, execute complete sanitization exceeding EPA standards, and coordinate backwater valve installation preventing future backups. We're experienced with FEMA documentation for sewer backup claims and understand insurance coverage complexities for this specific issue."}]},testimonialsSection:{header:"What Clarendon Residents Say",testimonials:[{author:"Rachel P.",location:"Clarendon Rowhouse Owner",text:"Our 1920s rowhouse had a pipe burst behind the plaster walls.
