Second, turn off electricity to affected areas if you can do so safely from the main panel. Third, stop the water source if possible. Fourth, call your insurance company and a professional restoration company. Do not enter standing water or touch electrical components."},{question:"When should I call 911 for water damage?",answer:"Call 911 if: there's significant structural damage or collapse, you smell gas or suspect a gas leak, electrical hazards exist that you cannot safely shut off, or if anyone is injured. For water damage alone without these hazards, call a restoration company directly."},{question:"Should I wait for insurance approval before calling restoration services?",answer:"No. Your insurance policy requires you to mitigate damage immediately. Waiting can lead to mold growth, structural damage, and claim denial. Call restoration services within the first 24 hours. Professional companies like Flood Doctor bill insurance directly and document everything for your claim."},{question:"How long do I have before mold starts growing?",answer:"Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours in wet conditions. That's why emergency mitigation must begin immediately. Professional water extraction and drying equipment can prevent mold if deployed quickly enough."},{question:"What items should I prioritize saving from water damage?",answer:"Priority order: 1) Important documents (insurance, titles, medical records), 2) Medications and medical supplies, 3) Electronics and data storage, 4) Sentimental items (photos, heirlooms), 5) High-value items (jewelry, collectibles), 6) Furniture and clothing. Move items to dry areas or elevate them above water level."},{question:"Can I clean up water damage myself?",answer:"Small, clean water events (less than 10 square feet from a clean source) may be manageable with a wet/dry vacuum and fans. However, anything larger, contaminated water (sewage, flood water), or damage behind walls requires professional equipment and expertise. Category 2 and 3 water pose health risks."},{question:"What if the water damage happens overnight or on weekends?",answer:"Call immediately, even at 3 AM. Water damage restoration companies like Flood Doctor operate 24/7/365, including holidays. Water doesn't wait for business hours, and neither should you. Every hour of delay increases damage severity and costs."},{question:"Who do I call first: insurance or restoration company?",answer:"Call both as soon as the area is safe. Many restoration companies can handle the insurance call on your behalf while beginning emergency mitigation. Document everything with photos first. The restoration company will preserve evidence and create documentation for your claim."}],b={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:d.map(a=>({"@type":"Question",name:a.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:a.answer}}))},w=[{icon:D,title:"Electrical Safety",critical:!0,steps:["Do NOT enter standing water if electrical outlets or appliances are submerged","Turn off power at main circuit breaker if you can reach it safely (dry path only)","Unplug electronics and appliances in affected areas","Do not use electrical equipment while standing in water","Call electrician if unsure about electrical safety"]},{icon:T,title:"Gas & Fire Hazards",critical:!0,steps:["If you smell gas, evacuate immediately and call 911 from outside","Turn off gas at main valve if accessible and safe","Do not use candles or open flames (gas leaks may be present)","Avoid smoking in or near affected areas","Check water heater and gas appliances for damage"]},{icon:u,title:"Structural Integrity",critical:!0,steps:["Look for sagging ceilings, bulging walls, or warped floors","Do not enter if you hear cracking sounds or see structural damage","Stay away from damaged areas until professionals assess","Evacuate if ceiling water stains are spreading or dripping heavily","Check foundation and support beams in basement if accessible"]},{icon:W,title:"Health & Contamination",critical:!1,steps:["Assume flood water or sewage backup is contaminated","Wear protective gloves, boots, and N95 mask if entering affected area","Wash hands thoroughly after any contact with water or materials","Keep children and pets away from damaged areas","Seek medical attention if you have open wounds exposed to contaminated water"]}],v=[{source:"Burst Pipe or Supply Line",shutoff:"Turn off main water valve (usually near water meter or street)",urgency:"Immediate",icon:g,notes:"Locate and mark your main shutoff valve before emergencies.
