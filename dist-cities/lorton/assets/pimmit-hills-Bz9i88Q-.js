Pimmit Hills homes share common characteristics: post-war construction with single-story or split-level layouts, often on sloped lots with basements or crawlspaces. Many have original plumbing approaching 70 years old. Sump systems date from original construction. These homes have served families well, but aging infrastructure creates water damage vulnerabilities we understand and address.`,housingTypes:["1950s-1960s ramblers","Mid-century split-levels","Post-war colonials","Renovated mid-century homes","Newer infill construction"],commonIssues:["Basement flooding from aging sump pumps","Burst pipe damage from original galvanized plumbing","Foundation seepage on sloped lots","Crawlspace moisture in rambler-style homes","Storm drainage overwhelm during heavy rain"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["West Falls Church Metro station","Pimmit Hills Community Center","Route 7 (Leesburg Pike) corridor","Pimmit Run stream","Tysons Corner access"],schools:["Pimmit Hills families typically attend:","Lemon Road Elementary","Kilmer Middle School","Marshall High School","Private: Langley School nearby"],subdivisions:["Pimmit Hills proper","West Pimmit","Pimmit Run area","Near West Falls Church Metro","Route 7 corridor homes"],localFacts:["ZIP code: 22043","Median home value: $600K-800K","Average lot size: 0.15-0.25 acres","School district: Fairfax County Public Schools"]},serviceList:[{name:"Emergency Water Extraction",description:"Rapid response for Pimmit Hills basement flooding, burst pipes, and appliance failures.
