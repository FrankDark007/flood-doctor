Flooding from the Potomac River, Occoquan Reservoir, and flash flooding from severe storms are the most frequent threats requiring emergency preparedness."},{question:"How do I create a family emergency plan?",answer:"A comprehensive family emergency plan includes: designated meeting locations (one near home, one outside neighborhood), out-of-state emergency contact, evacuation routes and destinations, special needs accommodations, pet care arrangements, important documents copies, communication plan if separated, and regular practice drills. Update annually and ensure all family members know the plan."},{question:"What should be in a 72-hour emergency kit?",answer:"Your kit should include: water (1 gallon/person/day for 3 days), non-perishable food, battery/hand-crank radio, flashlight and extra batteries, first aid kit, medications (7-day supply), important documents (waterproof container), cash, phone chargers/power banks, basic tools, and hygiene items. Customize for infants, elderly, pets, and medical needs."},{question:"Should I evacuate or shelter in place during a disaster?",answer:"This depends on the disaster type and official guidance. Evacuate immediately for: mandatory evacuation orders, nearby hazardous materials incidents, rapidly rising floodwater, or approaching wildfire. Shelter in place for: tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms, and some chemical releases. Always follow local emergency management directives and monitor emergency alerts."},{question:"How can I protect my home from flood damage?",answer:"Key flood protection measures: install sump pump with battery backup, grade soil away from foundation, seal basement walls and floors, install backflow preventer on sewer line, elevate utilities and appliances, clear gutters and downspouts, consider flood vents for crawl spaces, and purchase NFIP flood insurance (standard homeowners doesn't cover floods)."},{question:"What are Fairfax County's emergency notification systems?",answer:"Fairfax County uses multiple alert systems: Fairfax Alerts (opt-in for emergency notifications), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA - automatic to cell phones), Emergency Alert System (EAS - TV/radio), and social media (@fairfaxcounty). Register for Fairfax Alerts at fairfaxcounty.gov/alerts. Arlington and Loudoun counties have similar systems."},{question:"Where are emergency shelters located in Northern Virginia?",answer:"Emergency shelters are activated as needed during disasters and vary by location and event. Fairfax County uses public schools and community centers. Check county emergency management websites during events for current shelter locations. Pre-identify pet-friendly shelters (limited availability) and special needs shelters if required. Register in advance for special needs shelters."},{question:"How long does it take FEMA to respond after a disaster declaration?",answer:"After a Presidential Disaster Declaration, FEMA typically opens Disaster Recovery Centers within 3-7 days. Individual Assistance registration opens immediately at DisasterAssistance.gov or 1-800-621-3362. Inspections occur within 10 days of registration. Initial grant payments can take 2-4 weeks. However, full recovery assistance can take months. Don't wait for FEMA—begin emergency mitigation immediately and file insurance claims promptly."}],p={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:h.map(s=>({"@type":"Question",name:s.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:s.answer}}))},g=[{risk:"Flooding & Flash Floods",icon:l,severity:"High",frequency:"Annual",areas:"Potomac River corridor, Occoquan Reservoir, Four Mile Run, Cameron Run, urban areas with poor drainage",season:"Year-round, peak spring/summer",description:"Northern Virginia experiences frequent flooding from heavy rainfall, river overflow, and poor urban drainage.
