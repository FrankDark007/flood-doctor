These demonstrate industry-standard training in proper drying techniques, moisture detection, and microbial remediation. In Virginia, contractors must also hold a valid Class A or Class C Contractor's License."},{question:"Should I use my insurance company's preferred restoration vendor?",answer:"You have the legal right to choose any licensed contractor, regardless of insurance recommendations. Insurance 'preferred vendors' work for the carrier and may prioritize cost reduction over thorough restoration. Independent companies like Flood Doctor advocate for your interests, ensuring all damage is documented and repairs are completed to industry standards."},{question:"How quickly should a restoration company respond?",answer:"For water damage, response time is critical. Look for companies offering 24/7 emergency service with on-site arrival within 60-90 minutes. Water extraction should begin within 24 hours to prevent mold growth. Companies with slower response times increase your risk of secondary damage and mold remediation costs."},{question:"What questions should I ask before hiring a restoration company?",answer:"Ask about: IICRC certifications, Virginia contractor license number, insurance coverage (general liability and workers' comp), response time guarantees, drying process and timeline, equipment used, experience with your type of damage, insurance claims support, and references from recent jobs. A reputable company will answer these questions clearly and provide documentation."},{question:"How do I verify a restoration company's license in Virginia?",answer:"Visit the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR) website at dpor.virginia.gov and search the License Lookup tool. Enter the company name or license number to verify active status, disciplinary history, and insurance coverage. All Virginia contractors performing work over $1,000 must be licensed."},{question:"What's the difference between a free estimate and an insurance estimate?",answer:"A free estimate provides a general scope and cost range for repairs. An insurance estimate (typically using Xactimate software) is a detailed, line-item breakdown compatible with insurance claim systems. Reputable companies provide both: an initial assessment at no charge, and a formal insurance estimate once the scope is determined."},{question:"Should I get multiple restoration estimates?",answer:"Yes, but prioritize qualifications over price. The lowest bid often cuts corners—using inadequate equipment, shorter drying times, or incomplete moisture mapping. Compare certifications, equipment, drying protocols, and insurance claim support. For insurance claims, most adjusters accept estimates from any IICRC-certified contractor using Xactimate."},{question:"What are red flags when choosing a restoration company?",answer:"Warning signs include: no IICRC certifications, unlicensed or uninsured, pressure tactics or requiring payment upfront, lack of written estimates or contracts, no 24/7 emergency service, unwillingness to provide references, and claims of 'we work directly with your insurance' without explaining your rights. Avoid companies that guarantee insurance approval—only adjusters make coverage decisions."}],j={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:m.map(t=>({"@type":"Question",name:t.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:t.answer}}))},w=[{name:"IICRC Water Damage Restoration (WRT)",icon:c,description:"Industry-standard certification covering water extraction, structural drying, and microbial prevention.
