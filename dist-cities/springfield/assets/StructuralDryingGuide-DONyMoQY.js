It uses controlled temperature, humidity, and airflow to restore materials to pre-loss moisture content levels, preventing mold growth, warping, and structural degradation."},{question:"How long does structural drying take?",answer:"Drying time depends on water damage class, materials affected, and environmental conditions. Class 1 typically takes 2-3 days. Class 2 takes 3-5 days. Class 3 takes 5-7 days. Class 4 (hardwood, concrete) can take 1-4 weeks. Professional monitoring ensures complete drying before equipment removal."},{question:"Can I dry water damage myself with fans and dehumidifiers?",answer:"Small, surface-level water damage (< 100 sq ft, Category 1) may be DIY-possible if caught immediately. However, most water damage requires professional equipment and expertise. Hidden moisture in wall cavities, under flooring, and in insulation cannot be detected or dried without specialized tools. Incomplete drying leads to mold and structural damage."},{question:"What is psychrometrics in water damage restoration?",answer:"Psychrometrics is the science of air-water vapor mixtures. Restoration technicians use psychrometric principles to measure temperature, relative humidity, and grains per pound (GPP) to calculate vapor pressure and evaporation potential. This data guides equipment placement and confirms when materials are dry."},{question:"What equipment is used for structural drying?",answer:"Professional drying uses air movers (create airflow across wet surfaces), dehumidifiers (remove moisture from air), axial fans (circulate air in large spaces), and specialty equipment like wall cavity drying systems, floor mat systems, and desiccant dehumidifiers. Moisture meters and thermal imaging detect hidden moisture."},{question:"How do you know when structural drying is complete?",answer:"Drying is complete when moisture meter readings match dry standard readings for each material type (established before water damage or from unaffected reference areas). Psychrometric readings should show stable, normal conditions. IICRC S500 requires three consecutive days of readings at or below dry standard before equipment removal."},{question:"Does structural drying prevent mold growth?",answer:"Yes, when done within 24-48 hours of water intrusion. Mold spores are everywhere but need moisture to grow. Rapid drying (< 48 hours) prevents germination. Professional drying also reduces humidity below 60% RH, the threshold for mold growth. Delayed or incomplete drying leads to mold colonization."},{question:"How much does professional structural drying cost?",answer:"Costs vary by class, affected area, and duration. Typical range: $1,500-$4,000 for Class 1-2 (small to medium), $4,000-$8,000 for Class 3 (large/saturated), and $8,000-$15,000+ for Class 4 (specialty drying). Most homeowners insurance covers professional drying as part of emergency mitigation."}],p={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:a.map(s=>({"@type":"Question",name:s.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:s.answer}}))},x=[{icon:o,title:"Temperature Control",description:"Warmer air holds more moisture.
