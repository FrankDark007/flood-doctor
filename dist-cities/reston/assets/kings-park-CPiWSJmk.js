When water threatens your Kings Park home, you need restoration experts who understand these classic 1970s-era homes and the families who love them.

Flood Doctor has served Kings Park families for nearly two decades. We've extracted flood water from lower-level family rooms during summer storms, dried the signature split-level layouts when sump pumps failed at 2 AM, and protected the homes where Kings Park families have raised multiple generations. Our response vehicles are positioned minutes from Kings Park—when you call about flooding, we're already nearby.

The housing stock here is predominantly split-level—that distinctive design with living spaces on multiple half-levels, including family rooms and bedrooms partially below grade. These below-grade spaces are wonderful for family life but vulnerable to flooding when sump pumps fail or storms overwhelm drainage. We understand Kings Park construction intimately and know exactly how to protect these homes.`,housingTypes:["Split-level homes (1970s)","Bi-level homes with walk-out basements","Some colonial renovations and additions","Single-story ranches on larger lots"],commonIssues:["Split-level lower-level flooding from sump pump failure","Aging 1970s plumbing supply line bursts","Foundation seepage through 50-year-old concrete","HVAC condensate issues in summer","Tree root sewer line intrusion"]},hyperLocalContent:{landmarks:["Lake Accotink Park","Kings Park Library","Kings Park Shopping Center","Braddock Road corridor","Accotink Creek"],schools:["Lake Braddock Secondary School","Kings Park Elementary School","Robinson Secondary School","Laurel Ridge Elementary","Irving Middle School"],subdivisions:["Kings Park West","Kings Park proper","Lakewood Hills","North Kings Park","Rolling Valley adjacent"],localFacts:["ZIP code: 22015","Developed primarily 1965-1975","Adjacent to Lake Accotink Park","Predominantly split-level construction"]},serviceList:[{name:"Split-Level Restoration",description:"Kings Park's split-level homes have unique water damage patterns.
